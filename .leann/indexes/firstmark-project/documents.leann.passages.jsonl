{"id": "0", "text": "# Repository Guidelines (FirstMark Talent Signal Agent Demo)\n\nThis repo is optimized around a live Talent Signal Agent demo for the FirstMark interview, centered on the Airtable + Flask + AGNO workflow defined in `case/technical_spec_V2.md` and narrated in the case brief.\n\n## What To Prioritize\n- Treat the case brief as the north star narrative (currently `reference/case_brief.md`) and `case/technical_spec_V2.md` as the source of truth for the implementation plan.\n- Any new code, notes, or experiments should support the Talent Signal Agent demo (screening workflow, role specs, research/assessment) rather than generic infra.\n- Capture case-specific reasoning, architectures, and drafts in `case/` (e.g., `case/WB-case_notes.md`, `case/*_appendix.md`), not in `reference/`.\n- Use `brainstorming/` for early sketches or rough plans that may later be distilled into the case deliverables.\n\n## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `case/`\n  - Contains the official prompt, technical spec (`technical_spec_V2.md`), and solution notes.", "metadata": {}}
{"id": "1", "text": "## Project Structure & Module Organization\n- `case/`\n  - Contains the official prompt, technical spec (`technical_spec_V2.md`), and solution notes.\n  - Treat `technical_spec_V2.md` as the canonical description of the demo architecture (Airtable tables, Flask endpoints, AGNO agents, data schemas).\n- `spec/`\n  - Older or auxiliary specs; refer to `case/technical_spec_V2.md` first for current decisions.\n- `scripts/`\n  - Holds all Node-based automation (`scrape_companies.js`, `process_portfolio.js`, `create_summary.js`) plus their README.\n  - Keep any new automation or data-processing tools here so data paths (defaulting to `../research`) remain consistent.\n  - Treat scripts as supporting tools (e.g., portfolio/exec datasets), not the main product.\n- `research/`\n  - Canonical home for generated datasets used by scripts and deeper firm/talent research.\n  - Includes portfolio exports, candidate/network mocks (e.g., `Mock_Guilds.csv`, `Exec_Network.csv`), and deeper notes (`member_research/`, `interview_research/`).", "metadata": {}}

{"id": "4", "text": "## Build, Test, and Development Commands\n- Node-based data prep (supporting, not primary):\n  - `cd scripts && node scrape_companies.js` scrapes FirstMark portfolio pages; start Chrome on `:9222` beforehand via `.claude/skills/web-browser/tools/start.js`.\n  - `cd scripts && node process_portfolio.js` transforms `research/portfolio_raw.json` into the Markdown table.\n  - `cd scripts && node create_summary.js` produces CSV and narrative summaries from the processed data.\n  - Run scripts with Node 18+ in an ES module–friendly setup; prefer project-local dependencies.\n- Python demo stack (primary):\n  - Follow `case/technical_spec_V2.md` for environment assumptions (Python version, AGNO/OpenAI dependencies, Flask/ngrok usage).\n  - Keep the Python surface area tight: one small Flask app, AGNO agents, and Airtable integration.", "metadata": {}}
{"id": "5", "text": "## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n- JavaScript:\n  - ES modules, 2-space indentation, camelCase variables, and small helper functions (`scrapeCompanyPage`) for clarity.\n  - Console logging should explain progress (`Found N unique companies`) and surface recoverable errors without exiting the process.\n- Python (demo code):\n  - Prefer clear, interview-friendly naming that reflects the Talent Signal Agent (e.g., `run_screening`, `create_research_agent`, `AssessmentResult`).\n  - Keep modules small and aligned with the spec: one Flask entrypoint, small AGNO/LLM helpers, and thin Airtable client functions.\n  - Favor explicit, typed Pydantic models for structured inputs/outputs, as in `case/technical_spec_V2.md`.\n- Data / files:\n  - Name derived data files with explicit scopes (`portfolio_detailed.json`, `member_research/AlexDR_ANT.md`, `Mock_Guilds.csv`) so downstream notes stay discoverable via `rg`.", "metadata": {}}
{"id": "6", "text": "## Testing & Validation Guidelines\n- No dedicated test suite exists.\n- Treat each script or demo run as an integration test:\n  - For Node scripts: verify deltas with `git status` and inspect generated artifacts in `research/` (and any mirrored copies under `reference/portfolio/`).\n  - For the Flask/AGNO demo: run through the Module 4 “Screen” flow with a small candidate set and verify Airtable status changes + outputs match the expectations in `case/technical_spec_V2.md`.\n- Before using generated data in the case narrative, perform spot checks and sanity-check that examples match the case brief (`reference/case_brief.md`).", "metadata": {}}
{"id": "7", "text": "## Communication & Versioning for the Case\n- Keep the main narrative concise and interview-ready in the case brief (currently `reference/case_brief.md`); move longer explorations into adjacent notes (e.g., `case/WB-case_notes.md` or `case/*_appendix.md`).\n- If multiple variants of the solution exist (e.g., different agent architectures), use explicit filenames (`case/agent_v1_spec_guided.md`, `case/agent_v2_async_reranker.md`) and cross-link from the case brief so it is clear which is the “final” interview version.\n- Avoid large, breaking restructures right before interviews; prefer small, incremental updates that preserve a stable, presentable case narrative.", "metadata": {}}
{"id": "8", "text": "## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n- Use concise, imperative messages with scope prefixes (`case: refine technical_spec`, `demo: add screen endpoint`, `scripts: update portfolio transform`).\n- Each PR (or logical commit group) should include:\n  - Short context summary.\n  - Affected directories.\n  - Sample output snippets or file sizes (for research/data changes).\n  - Any manual steps (Chrome port, ngrok URL, Airtable config assumptions).\n- Link to relevant briefs (`reference/case_brief.md`, `case/technical_spec_V2.md`, `research/Firm_DeepResearch.md`) so reviewers can trace decisions.\n\n## Data & Security Tips\n- Many `research/` and `reference/portfolio/` files contain scraped or interview-derived information; avoid sharing raw exports outside this repository and scrub PII before publishing or presenting.\n- Store API keys or browser credentials in your local environment, never inside tracked files; redact sensitive URLs from commit descriptions when referencing partner portals.\n- When creating mock datasets for the demo (e.g., `Mock_Guilds.csv`, `Exec_Network.csv`, bios, JDs), prefer synthetic or anonymized examples that still resemble realistic VC/talent workflows.", "metadata": {}}

{"id": "247", "text": "# Talent Signal Agent – Implementation Refinement Proposal\n\n> Proposal to tighten scope, architecture, and evaluation of the Talent Signal Agent demo, grounded in `case/case_requirements.md` and `case/technical_spec.md`.\n\nThis proposal addresses the main gaps in the current spec and converts them into a concrete, demo‑ready plan. Each section lists the proposed actions and why they are the right tradeoffs for this case.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Clarify Minimal Demo Scope\n\n**Proposed Actions**\n- Designate one “hero” flow as the core of the demo: pre‑loaded People + Roles in Airtable → create `Screen` → click “Start Screening” → ranked matches with reasoning written back.\n- Treat other flows (Upload, New Role, New Search, Deep Research UI) as simplified or conceptual: use static records and simple forms in Airtable, with no additional automation beyond what is required for screening.\n- Restrict the live candidate set to ~10–20 executives and 3–4 roles (2 CFO, 2 CTO) so that a full screen can run end‑to‑end in a few minutes.", "metadata": {}}
{"id": "248", "text": "**Rationale**\n- Aligns with the rubric’s emphasis on clear value and insight generation rather than breadth of features; one excellent workflow beats many half‑finished ones.\n- Reduces implementation risk and cognitive load for the interview; most of the 30 minutes can be spent on the matching logic and reasoning trail, not on plumbing.\n- Still shows extensibility: Upload, New Role, and New Search remain visible in the Airtable schema and UI, but the demo story centers on the screening workflow that is explicitly called out as most important in `solution_strategy.md`.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Make Airtable Schemas Concrete\n\n**Proposed Actions**\n- Define a small, explicit Airtable schema and treat it as the contract between Airtable and the Python workflow:\n  - `People`: `exec_id`, `Name`, `Current Title`, `Company`, `Role Type` (CTO/CFO), `Stage`, `Sector`, `Location`, `LinkedIn URL`, `Bio (long text)`, `Relationship Type`, `Research Summary (long text)`.", "metadata": {}}

Define Prompting & Context Strategy", "metadata": {}}
{"id": "255", "text": "**Proposed Actions**\n- Split the LLM work into two clear steps with distinct prompts:\n  1. **Research step** (Deep Research API):\n     - Inputs: LinkedIn URL (if available), any existing bio text, current title/company, role type.\n     - Output: a concise JSON summary of career history, stage/sector exposure, team scale, fundraising/exit experience, and notable signals or red flags.\n  2. **Assessment step** (assessment model call):\n     - Inputs: role JD text, role spec (JSON + brief Markdown), research summary JSON, and basic People fields.\n     - Output: rubric‑aligned scores, confidence levels, short rationales, and 1–2 counterfactuals, all in a strict JSON schema.\n- For long bios or job descriptions, first ask the model to generate a 300–400‑word normalized summary that is then used as the context for assessment.\n- Use sectioned prompts (e.g., `CONTEXT:`, `ROLE:`, `CANDIDATE:`, `TASK:`) and enforce a fixed JSON response format; validate and coerce responses in Python.", "metadata": {}}
{"id": "256", "text": "**Rationale**\n- Separating research from assessment matches how a human would work (first understand the candidate, then judge fit) and makes debugging easier.\n- Keeps prompt length under control and reduces redundancy; the assessment step reads a compact summary instead of raw, messy bios or full JDs.\n- A strict, documented JSON schema reduces demo‑day surprises and lets you show “structured outputs” explicitly, which maps to the Technical Design and Data Integration rubric categories.\n\n---\n\n## 5.

Add Error & Edge‑Case Handling\n\n**Proposed Actions**\n- Wrap each candidate’s processing in try/except blocks so a single failure does not kill the entire screen:\n  - If research fails: log the error, mark the role eval for that candidate as `Error` with a clear reason, and optionally run a degraded assessment using only structured fields.\n  - If assessment JSON fails validation: retry once with a stricter prompt asking for “valid JSON only”; on second failure, store the raw reasoning text and assign `Low` confidence.\n  - If no candidates pass filters or thresholds: write a “No strong matches” summary into the `Screen` record, including 1–2 borderline candidates with explanations of why they are weak fits.\n  - If Airtable write operations fail: log the error and keep the process idempotent (re‑running the same screen overwrites or upserts existing evals rather than duplicating them).\n- Use a simple state machine for `Screen.Status`: `Ready` → `Processing` → `Complete` or `Error`, and ensure that status is updated even when partial failures occur.", "metadata": {}}
{"id": "258", "text": "**Rationale**\n- Demonstrates pragmatic engineering discipline: the system behaves predictably under partial failure, which is something a real platform team would care about.\n- Supports a smoother live demo; you avoid awkward hard failures and can talk through how the system responds to imperfect data or flaky external APIs.\n- Adds credibility under the “Product Thinking” and “Technical Design” rubric elements by showing that error paths are intentionally designed, not ignored.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Cover Non‑Functional Concerns", "metadata": {}}
{"id": "259", "text": "---\n\n## 6. Cover Non‑Functional Concerns\n\n**Proposed Actions**\n- Introduce basic guardrails for rate limits and cost:\n  - Cap the number of live candidates per screen (e.g., 10–15).\n  - Expose configuration for max candidates and model choices via environment variables or a small config file.\n  - Prefer “light” Deep Research settings appropriate for short, focused executive checks.\n- Handle secrets and connectivity cleanly:\n  - Store all API keys (OpenAI, Tavily, ngrok) only in `.env` and load via `python-dotenv`; never hard‑code secrets or commit them.\n  - Document the minimal steps to start Flask + ngrok + Airtable automations for the demo.\n- Add a lightweight validation and testing loop:\n  - Build a small offline fixture dataset (5–10 people, 2 roles) and a script to run the screening logic without Airtable (pure Python) for quick iteration.\n  - Add minimal tests or assertions around JSON parsing and scoring logic to ensure regression‑free changes.", "metadata": {}}
{"id": "260", "text": "**Rationale**\n- Shows that the design is production‑aware even though this is a demo; reviewers see that cost, rate limits, and security are acknowledged and managed.\n- Makes it easier for you to iterate safely before the interview and rerun the demo in a controlled way.\n- Directly supports the Communication & Clarity rubric item by giving a simple, repeatable “how to run this” story.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Define Agent Evaluation & Success Criteria", "metadata": {}}
{"id": "261", "text": "---\n\n## 7. Define Agent Evaluation & Success Criteria\n\n**Proposed Actions**\n- Create a tiny “gold set” of candidates for each of the 3–4 demo roles, manually labeled as `Strong Fit`, `Maybe`, or `No` based on your own judgment and the role spec.\n- After running the agent, compare:\n  - Whether the system’s top‑3 per role roughly aligns with the `Strong Fit` and `Maybe` labels.\n  - Where the agent disagrees and whether its reasoning is still defensible or reveals useful counter‑signals.\n- Collect 2–3 concrete stories to highlight in the presentation, for example:\n  - A non‑obvious candidate that the agent surfaces as a strong fit and why.\n  - A candidate who looks good on paper but is correctly downgraded because stage/sector/context don’t match.\n- Use these examples as a mini “user study” within the presentation, showing how a FirstMark partner or platform lead might respond to the rankings.", "metadata": {}}
{"id": "262", "text": "**Rationale**\n- Translates the rubric from abstract criteria into tangible outcomes: “Would I actually use this ranking?” becomes a question you can answer with examples.\n- Reinforces that this is not just a toy demo: the evaluation loop mirrors how you would validate such a system if it were launched inside the firm.\n- Gives you compelling, story‑driven moments in the presentation that tie together product thinking, technical design, and insight generation.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nCollectively, these actions narrow the demo to one excellent, end‑to‑end screening workflow while still showcasing a thoughtful, extensible architecture. They make the Airtable schema, matching logic, prompts, and error handling concrete enough to implement quickly, and they create a clear evaluation story that maps directly to FirstMark’s case rubric. This should help the interviewers see both how you think and how you would build a real, usable Talent Signal Agent over time.", "metadata": {}}
