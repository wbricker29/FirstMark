---

# **30‑sec opener (you → they)**

“Thanks for hosting me. I build AI systems that turn messy research into decision‑ready outputs—fast, auditable, and operator‑friendly. Recently I’ve shipped RAG‑driven pipelines and agentic workflows for investment research and diligence. I’m excited to compare that approach to FirstMark’s builder DNA and NYC network, and explore where it could make your platform—and portfolio—meaningfully faster.”

---

# **Logistics (light)**

- **Location:** FirstMark, **641 Avenue of the Americas (6th Ave), NYC** (their legal/ops mail address lists this building). Plan a **10‑min check‑in buffer** with security/elevator.
- **Flow:** Arrive 11:50 → Beth 12:00 → Alex 12:45 → Ryan 1:15 → out by ~2:05 to debrief.

---

# **Crisp closes (per meeting)**

- **Beth:** propose a 2‑week spike: “platform ops telemetry + founder‑facing research copilot prototype,” success = weekly usage + time‑saved.
- **Alex:** offer a no‑risk audit of IC packet generation (map sources, latencies, breakpoints) → 10‑day automation plan.
- **Ryan:** ask for one live diligence thread to run in parallel, with a side‑by‑side output to compare speed/quality.

---

If you want, I can also: (a) draft the three 1‑pagers, (b) prebuild the 60‑sec demo script, and (c) assemble a leave‑by block with a 15‑min arrival buffer.

# **FirstMark Interviewers: Beth Viner, Alex Derbyshire, and Ryan Sullivan**

## **Beth Viner – Partner & Head of Platform at FirstMark**

**Professional Background:** Beth Viner is a Partner and Head of Platform at FirstMark, where she focuses on helping founders scale from “day zero” to growth by leveraging FirstMark’s talent network, insights, and ecosystem  . She joined FirstMark in mid-2025 after a career spanning leadership roles in venture building, startups, and brand strategy. Prior to FirstMark, Beth was a Managing Director & Partner at Boston Consulting Group (BCG), leading **BCG Digital Ventures (now BCG X)** – a global corporate venture-building arm – overseeing a team of ~1,000 technologists and operators to launch new businesses (from a GenAI skincare platform for L’Oréal to fintech tools for first-time homebuyers) . She also chaired Diversity, Equity & Inclusion for BCG X , reflecting her commitment to inclusive innovation (a trait likely to carry into how she evaluates teams and culture [Confidence: High]). Earlier, she was COO and CMO at **Kickstarter**, setting company-wide strategy and developing new products for creators . She also served as CEO of **Interbrand**’s New York and San Francisco offices, and spent nearly a decade at **IDEO**, building and leading new practices and studios . Her early career included roles at Trilogy Software, Ford, and Nike , giving her a blend of tech, design, and corporate experience. Beth holds an MBA from Stanford and triple B.A. degrees in Communication, History, and Spanish from the University of Pennsylvania .

**Notable Insights and Achievements:** Beth is a recognized thought leader on bridging vision and execution. In late 2023 she delivered a TED@BCG Talk titled *“Why businesses need a dreamer’s magic and a doer’s realism,”* emphasizing that true innovation happens when visionary *“dreamers”* partner with pragmatic *“doers”* . She lays out a practical blueprint for harnessing creative ideas with operational discipline – a philosophy likely reflecting her own style of combining big-picture creativity (from her IDEO/design background) with executional rigor (from her strategy and venture-building work) . This balance between imaginative thinking and realistic action is something she values highly [Confidence: High]. Colleagues have noted FirstMark’s culture is *“curious, rigorous, values-driven, and wildly fun,”* traits Beth herself admires  – suggesting she strives to bring energy and intellectual depth to her relationships with founders [Confidence: High].

Beth also actively engages with the broader innovation community. She serves on the board of **POV/American Documentary** (which produces the PBS *POV* documentary series) and on the **Marketplace Board of Advisors** , indicating her interest in storytelling, media, and social impact. This outside involvement hints that she appreciates narrative and mission in business, not just growth metrics [Confidence: High].

**Personal and Unique Details:** On social media, Beth playfully describes herself as an *“early bird, book lover, [and] abandoner of high heels for sneakers”* . This suggests she’s energetic and up early (perhaps to fit in a workout or reading), values continual learning, and favors practicality over pretension in her style (trading heels for sneakers implies a down-to-earth, ready-to-hustle attitude) – [Confidence: High]. In fact, Beth has been *“crossfit obsessed”* by her own past account, even competing in CrossFit Open competitions around 2013–2015 . She ranked roughly in the top 15,000 worldwide among women in those years , which, while recreational, shows a commitment to fitness and perseverance. This athletic hobby underscores her high personal drive and comfort with pushing limits [Confidence: High]. (She once quipped that she’s even *“contemplating dog ownership,”* hinting at personal goals outside of work  – a humanizing detail, though current status unknown [Confidence: Low].) Originating from Tucson, Arizona, Beth remains a loyal University of Arizona Wildcats basketball fan despite her Penn and Stanford alumni ties . This loyalty to her roots suggests a sense of pride and authenticity that might show in her interpersonal style [Confidence: Medium].

**Engaging with Beth – Psychological Profile:** Beth comes across as **highly enthusiastic, versatile, and people-focused**. She thrives on the “company-building journey,” loving both the fuzzy, passionate early stages of a startup and the later challenges of scaling or pivoting  . Expect her to be animated by big ideas – she enjoys *“ambitious, creative, slightly unreasonable people”* with audacious visions  – but she will also probe on execution plans, given her belief in pairing dreams with realism. When speaking with Beth, it may help to **demonstrate both vision and practicality**: for example, share a bold idea you have, but also discuss how to implement it step-by-step. She will likely appreciate a candidate who is **curious and well-read** (mentioning a favorite book or an industry article could resonate with her “book lover” side) and someone who has **personal drive and discipline** (e.g. referencing a marathon you ran or a project you saw through, which parallels her fitness and career perseverance) [Confidence: High].

Beth’s broad experience means she can connect on many topics – from design thinking and brand storytelling to venture capital trends. Notably, she might be *pleasantly surprised* if you bring up her TED Talk theme or her cross-functional career. Citing her own mantra about dreamers and doers, and perhaps aligning it with how you work on teams, could impress her that you’ve done deep research . Additionally, because she has championed DEI and creative communities, showing **values-driven thinking** (like how you built diverse teams or support creative pursuits) can strike a positive chord [Confidence: High]. In conversation, Beth is likely to be upbeat, **fast-paced, and intellectually curious**. She may pose thoughtful, open-ended questions. **Answer with authenticity and enthusiasm** – she has a keen radar for genuine passion. Given her abandonment of corporate formalities (remember those sneakers), you can expect her to be approachable and informal in tone, yet incisive. Overall, engaging Beth successfully means conveying **big-picture vision with grounded execution, personal energy, and a mindset of continuous learning** – reflecting the very blend of “magic and realism” that she espouses.

## **Alex Derbyshire – Chief of Staff to the COO at FirstMark**

**Professional Background:** Alex Derbyshire is the Chief of Staff to FirstMark’s COO (Shilpa Nayyar), responsible for managing the **operational rhythm** of the firm and building a “best-in-class” venture organization . In this pivotal internal role, Alex coordinates strategy, processes, and special projects across teams – essentially acting as a force-multiplier for leadership. Her career began in strategy consulting at **Accenture**, where she advised retail and media companies on corporate strategy . She then moved into the startup world as Chief of Staff at **Daring**, a venture-backed food tech startup known for its plant-based “chicken” products . At Daring, she would have worn many hats, supporting the CEO/founders in everything from operations to OKRs (she even spoke on a panel about OKRs at early-stage companies in 2022) . This mix of consulting and startup experience suggests she’s adept at both high-level strategic planning and day-to-day execution firefighting [Confidence: High].

Alex earned her B.S. **with honors** from the University of Virginia’s McIntire School of Commerce and simultaneously a B.A. in English Literature  – a dual accomplishment that highlights both analytical business training and a strong foundation in the humanities. She later obtained her MBA from **Columbia Business School** . (Notably, balancing Commerce and English in undergrad hints at a person who appreciates *both* quantitative analysis and storytelling – a useful blend for a role that involves communicating plans and motivating people [Confidence: High].)

**Notable Insights and Traits:** Unlike the others, Alex maintains a lower public profile, fitting for a behind-the-scenes Chief of Staff. There aren’t splashy articles or talks by Alex, which implies she operates more in *“operator”* mode than as a public-facing figure. She appears to be a **highly organized, adaptable, and trusted right-hand person** to executives. Evidence of this is her repeat choice of Chief of Staff roles – at Daring and now at FirstMark – which typically require exceptional **communication skills, discretion, and systems-thinking** to keep an organization running smoothly. Given her consulting background, she’s likely very comfortable with structured problem-solving and using frameworks. And having advised retail/media at Accenture and then working in a food startup, she has a breadth of industry exposure, suggesting intellectual curiosity and quick learning ability [Confidence: High].

One unique aspect is Alex’s strong academic performance and **diverse interests in school**. Studying English literature alongside business indicates she might be an avid reader or writer. She could have an appreciation for clear writing and narratives, which might translate to how she crafts internal memos or strategic documents. (It might pleasantly surprise her if you reference a classic novel or a piece of literature in an analogy – something an English-lit grad would enjoy – [Confidence: Medium].) Additionally, graduating with honors and later getting an MBA from a top school signals **ambition and discipline**. We can infer she sets high standards for herself and likely expects the same professionalism and preparedness from others [Confidence: High].

While we don’t have confirmed personal hobbies for Alex, we know she has engaged in professional communities. For instance, she participated in industry roundtables like the Voray event on startup OKRs , so she is keen on best practices and continuous improvement. She may also have a network from UVA and Columbia; UVA is known for a collegial culture and Columbia for a strong finance network. If one were to guess, Alex might enjoy activities that many ex-consultants and MBAs do – perhaps traveling, fitness classes, or exploring NYC’s restaurants – but these are speculative. What’s safer to note is her likely *“people orientation.”* A Chief of Staff often has to build rapport across the org chart, so she’s probably personable and a good listener, even if her role is internally focused [Confidence: High].

**Engaging with Alex – Psychological Profile:** Alex is likely **detail-oriented, efficient, and quietly influential**. In an interview setting, she may be the one observing how you fit culturally and operationally into the firm. **Expect structured questions** – e.g. she might inquire about how you handle multiple projects or how you’ve improved a process – to gauge your organizational skills (something she excels at). Given her operational purview, she will appreciate **clarity and conciseness** in your answers. It’s wise to be specific: when describing accomplishments, mention the steps you took and results, which will resonate with her process-driven mindset [Confidence: High].

To build rapport, you might find common ground on educational experiences or team projects. If appropriate, mentioning something about UVA (her alma mater) or Columbia could spark a connection (perhaps she follows UVA basketball or remembers case competitions at Columbia – a light touch of those topics could personalize the conversation [Confidence: Low]). More reliably, you could engage her by asking about **FirstMark’s internal culture** or how the firm implements best practices (as someone who “builds the organization,” she’ll have thoughtful views on this). Demonstrating that you value good organization and culture shows you “speak her language.” For example, you might say, “I read how FirstMark emphasizes being a best-in-class organization – in my last role I started a weekly ops dashboard to improve our team’s rhythm. I’d love to learn how Alex, as Chief of Staff, keeps things running tightly.” This not only shows you did homework but also subtly acknowledges her important role, which she would likely appreciate [Confidence: Medium].

In terms of demeanor, Alex will probably be **professional and calm**. Chiefs of Staff often have seen it all and don’t get easily flustered. She may have a reserved demeanor compared to, say, a very extroverted investor, but she will be attentive. **Show that you are reliable and collaborative**, since she highly values those who can execute plans without hand-holding (she’s used to being the organizer, not necessarily wanting to micromanage others) [Confidence: Medium]. If you exhibit sincerity, thoroughness in your answers, and respect for well-run operations, you’ll align well with what Alex stands for. She might be pleasantly surprised if you picked up on her interdisciplinary background – for instance, “With your literature background, you probably appreciate good communication; I make a point to write clear project updates weekly…” – a subtle nod to her English Lit side could make you memorable [Confidence: Low]. Overall, **come prepared, stay structured, and connect on the value of effective organization** – this will demonstrate to Alex that you can contribute to the high-performance environment she works hard to maintain.

## **Ryan Sullivan – Investor at FirstMark (Enterprise & Infrastructure Focus)**

**Professional Background:** Ryan Sullivan is an Investor at FirstMark, concentrating on **enterprise software and infrastructure** investments . In this role, he sources and evaluates new deals and supports portfolio companies, especially in areas like B2B software and cybersecurity. Ryan’s background is rooted in growth equity and tech. Before joining FirstMark, he worked at **Ansa Capital** and **M33 Growth**, where he honed his investment skills and even built quantitative tools – for example, he developed company scoring models and a custom workflow automation platform to streamline investing operations . This indicates he brings a data-driven approach to VC (writing code or at least designing systems to improve decision-making). Prior to M33, Ryan was on the investing team at **Summit Partners**, a top-tier growth equity firm, where he helped evaluate potential investments and assisted a portfolio company (Harvey Performance Co.) with M&A strategy . He also had hands-on tech experience: before Summit, he worked at **UiPath**, the robotic process automation leader, developing RPA workflows to improve internal sales operations . This is a unique combination – few investors have actually built automation bots – and it shows Ryan’s strong technical aptitude alongside investment acumen.

Ryan graduated **cum laude** from the University of Notre Dame with a B.B.A. in Finance and a minor in Computing & Digital Technologies (specializing in Cyber Safety & Security) . In Notre Dame’s interdisciplinary program, he blended business with computer science, which clearly set the foundation for his tech-focused finance career. While at ND, he also worked for an AWS cloud consulting startup (Trek10) and volunteered as a mentor with Big Brothers Big Sisters  – demonstrating early leadership and community engagement. His academic honors and breadth of experience suggest a *high achiever* who is comfortable balancing multiple commitments [Confidence: High].

**Notable Insights and Interests:** One particularly fun fact: **Ryan is an avid New England Patriots fan**. According to his bio at M33, he proudly attended both the legendary Super Bowl where the Patriots came back from a 28–3 deficit to win, and the infamous “Deflategate” AFC Championship game . This shows not only his passion for sports but also a penchant for high-stakes situations! If you mention those games, he’ll know you did your homework – it’s a distinctive personal detail he’d likely be surprised AI found. It also implies he might be originally from the New England area or at least shares that culture of Patriots/Boston sports enthusiasm [Confidence: Medium]. Outside of work, Ryan enjoys **skiing and golfing** . Skiing suggests he likes outdoor adventure and challenge, and golf indicates patience and strategy – both relevant in metaphorical ways to investing (downhill speed vs. long-game strategy). He also enjoys watching football (of course) . These hobbies give you easy touchpoints: for instance, friendly banter about the NFL or asking if he’s been golfing at any NYC-area courses could build rapport [Confidence: Medium].

On the professional side, Ryan is described by colleagues as **analytical and innovative**. The fact that at a young age he created automated tools for his job shows initiative and a hacker mindset. He likely approaches problems by asking “How can we do this smarter or faster?” [Confidence: High]. He also has a strong foundation in cybersecurity (his academic focus), so he might have keen insight into areas like enterprise security startups. He has contributed to content like FirstMark’s “MAD (Machine Learning, AI, Data) landscape” refresh (his name appears in acknowledgments of a recent AI landscape project) . This indicates he’s actively involved in the cutting-edge tech conversations at the firm, particularly around AI/ML.

Ryan’s mix of growth equity (which involves rigorous financial modeling) and venture tech focus means he values **metrics and market data**, but also understands cutting-edge tech trends. He straddles the line between quantitative thinker and tech enthusiast. Importantly, his volunteer mentoring with Big Brothers Big Sisters suggests he’s community-minded and enjoys coaching – perhaps reflective of a personable, team-oriented side [Confidence: High].

**Engaging with Ryan – Psychological Profile:** Ryan is likely **bright, driven, and personable** with an analytical tilt. In an interview, he may zero in on **your understanding of technology or your ability to parse data** since he himself is technically proficient. Be prepared for questions about how you solve complex problems or learn new technical concepts quickly. If you have any experience with coding, automation, or just a structured approach to analysis, mention it – he’ll appreciate those who can blend business with tech as he does [Confidence: High].

At the same time, Ryan seems very down-to-earth. His sports enthusiasm and extracurriculars imply he’s approachable and can bond over shared interests. **Don’t hesitate to engage him in a bit of sports or hobby talk** if the opportunity arises; for example, congratulating him (in a friendly teasing way) on the Patriots’ latest season or mentioning a recent ski trip of your own could create a warm connection [Confidence: Medium]. He’ll likely light up talking about a thrilling Pats game or a favorite ski resort – those are passions outside the boardroom that make him human. Just be sure not to fake interest – if you truly know something about those topics, it can be a great icebreaker.

In terms of meeting dynamics, given Ryan is earlier in his VC career (Notre Dame ’18 or so, presumably late 20s), he might adopt a conversational and curious tone rather than an overtly high-pressure one. He might be testing for raw intelligence and cultural fit. Show him you can **think on your feet and enjoy learning**. For instance, if discussing a market, you could say, “I read the latest Machine Learning landscape that FirstMark put out and found the section on data infrastructure interesting…” (he was involved in those efforts , so this would both flatter and engage on his interests). Demonstrating knowledge of enterprise tech trends or asking his opinion on, say, a recent cybersecurity news item could impress him with your proactiveness [Confidence: High].

Ryan’s **growth equity experience** means he might appreciate candidates who are **metrics-driven**. When talking about your achievements, quantify them if possible (e.g., “improved X by 30%”). This mirrors how he thinks about companies (in KPIs and growth rates). Also, consider that as a former Big Brothers Big Sisters mentor, he values mentorship and humility – he might respond well to someone who is **coachable and team-oriented**, not just individually brilliant [Confidence: High]. So mention times you learned from others or helped others succeed; this aligns with his evident inclination to mentor and collaborate.

Lastly, a subtle but powerful way to engage Ryan is to relate something to his **Patriots fandom** in a professional metaphor. For example, “I approach complex projects like a football game – with a game plan but the ability to call audibles when conditions change,” or even lightheartedly, “I strive to maintain Brady-like focus under pressure.” Such remarks, if not overdone, can make the interaction memorable and show you’ve paid attention to what makes him tick [Confidence: Medium]. Just ensure any humor is professional and context-appropriate.

In summary, **connecting with Ryan** means showing enthusiasm for tech and data, a bit of personality (especially around sports or hobbies), and a mindset of continuous improvement (automation and optimization are themes of his career). He’ll be impressed that you uncovered specific details like his Patriots story  or his UiPath automation work – it demonstrates excellent research diligence. Convey that same diligence and curiosity in how you’d approach the job, and Ryan will recognize a kindred spirit who is analytical yet well-rounded.

- Talk about **community**: your RAG resume project, your Prepared Mind work, or any ecosystem you’ve built is directly legible to him as a real edge.
- You can go **deeply technical and architectural** with him; he won’t be scared off.

**Avoid:**

- Shallow “ChatGPT changed everything overnight” takes; he has receipts from 10+ years of watching this market evolve.
- Pretending you know a specific data tool or architecture if you don’t; he reads BS very quickly.

### **3.4 “They’d be impressed AI found this…”**

- That you know **Data Driven NYC has run 90+ events, 19K+ members, 330+ speakers**, and you see it as both **deal flow and talent/customer engine** for the portfolio.
- That you’re aware he **first met Dataiku when they spoke at Data Driven NYC in 2013, then led their Series A**, and can use that as an example of **community-led sourcing**.

- **GTM-obsessed operator**: Built Dropbox’s partner and revenue partnerships, helping scale via channel and BD.
  - *Inference:* Cares a *lot* about **distribution, negative CAC, and channel-driven growth**, not just clever product.
  - **Confidence:** High.
- **Community as infrastructure**: Fintech Driven and his role in FirstMark’s Founder Guild show he uses **curated, invite-only groups as leverage**.
  - *Inference:* Very responsive to people who can **design and animate communities**.
  - **Confidence:** High.
- **Analytical but founder-friendly**: Comes across in content as optimistic, with a “force multiplier” stance – clear view of fintech market evolution and “negative CAC” markets.
  - *Inference:* Likes **crisp market maps** and **hands-on help** more than abstract pontification.
  - **Confidence:** Medium–High.
- **Comfortable in messy finance adjacencies**: Fintech, capital markets modernization, new distribution models.
  - *Inference:* Open to **non-obvious, regulated, or multi-stakeholder plays** if the GTM is sharp.
  - **Confidence:** Medium.

### **4.3 How to Play the Meeting**

- Lead with **distribution-centric thinking**. For any product or idea, answer: *How does it get customers at lower CAC over time?*
- Show him you understand **how software can sit on transaction flows** and become a financial layer (negative CAC theme).
- Connect your background to **both operator and investor mindsets**—he’s done both at high-signal places (Dropbox, Social Capital, SPC).
- Ask him about **Fintech Driven** and what patterns he sees among the best fintech founders; then respond with how your own approach dovetails.

**Avoid:**

- Pure “AI + finance” slogans without understanding of **compliance, distribution partners, or balance-sheet risk**.
- Presenting yourself as someone who hates dealing with messy operational or GTM details.

### **4.4 “They’d be impressed AI found this…”**

- That you know he **built Fintech Driven into the in-person hub for NYC fintech**, with closed-door sessions from top founders and Goldman partners.
- That you’ve read about his **Negative CAC Market Map** and can talk about a company (even outside his portfolio) that fits that pattern.

## **5. Shilpa Nayyar – Partner & COO**

### **5.1 Snapshot & Portfolio / Role**

- Partner & Chief Operating Officer at FirstMark; she leads **all non-investment activities**, including internal ops and **Investor Relations**, and partners with the investment team on firm-level strategy.
- Previously **Chief of Staff to Stephen A. Schwarzman** at Blackstone.
- Held multiple senior roles at **Credit Suisse**: Head of Strategy for Investment Banking & Capital Markets, COO of Financial Sponsors & LA Investment Banking, plus earlier healthcare IB roles.
- BA in Economics + BAS in Applied Science from Penn, MBA from Wharton.
- Board member at **HealthEC**, a population-health technology company.

**Very under-the-radar but telling:**

- In Schwarzman’s book *What It Takes*, he explicitly thanks his chief of staff **Shilpa Nayyar** for drafting sections and coordinating edits across readers – she was effectively **co-producer and editor of his autobiography project**.

### **5.2 How Shilpa Thinks (Inferred)**

- **Elite execution + discretion**: Serving as Schwarzman’s CoS and helping shape his book means she’s trusted with **high-stakes, highly confidential work**.
  - *Inference:* Extremely high bar for **professionalism, clarity, and reliability**.
  - **Confidence:** High.
- **Organization-builder mindset**: Her FirstMark bio literally centers on “building a best-in-class organization with a winning culture”.
  - *Inference:* She cares about **systems, culture, and operating cadence**, not just outputs.
  - **Confidence:** High.
- **Finance + tech crossover**: From Credit Suisse healthcare and sponsors to Blackstone, now VC, plus board work at a health tech company.
  - *Inference:* She is very comfortable around **complex capital structures, LP expectations, and regulated environments**.
  - **Confidence:** Medium–High.
- **Emerging health-tech investor**: Evalyze tags her as focusing on **health IT and medical services** checks in the $250K–$10M range.
  - *Inference:* Has a side lens as a **sector specialist** whose pattern recognition in health data may inform FirstMark ops and strategy.
  - **Confidence:** Medium.

### **5.3 How to Play the Meeting**

- Treat this as a conversation with the **firm’s operating nucleus**. She’s thinking: *“Can this person help us run a sharper, more scalable, LP-worthy org?”*
- Emphasize your ability to **design and run systems**: data pipelines, research processes, IC prep, dashboards, report workflows – with clear metrics.
- Signal you understand the **LP lens**: how AI and ops changes can translate into better reporting, risk management, and fund-level differentiation.
- Reference your experience building **end-to-end workflows** where humans are positioned for high-leverage judgment (this aligns with how she ran Blackstone/CS strategic work).

**Avoid:**

- Being casual or sloppy about details; she has lived in execution-heavy environments for two decades.
- Sounding like you want to just “hack” things together ad hoc rather than building **durable, auditable systems**.

### **5.4 “They’d be impressed AI found this…”**

- That you know she **coordinated and drafted parts of Schwarzman’s book**, and can frame that as proof of her ability to handle large, complex, multi-stakeholder projects.
- That you’re aware of her **HealthEC board role** and can tie your view of AI-driven healthcare / population health infrastructure into the discussion.

## **Quick tactical recap (for you):**

- **Rick:** Come in swinging with **macro + AI + outlier-founder** thinking. Use competitive framing; know his sports + movie nerd angle.
- **Amish:** Bring **enterprise/cloud pattern recognition** and **ecosystem thinking**; show long-term, principled judgment.
- **Matt:** Go deep on **data/AI architecture and history**; reference MAD & Data Driven NYC; demonstrate you’re not new to this wave.
- **Adam:** Lead with **GTM and distribution**; talk about negative CAC and community-as-infra; tie to fintech and vertical SaaS.
- **Shilpa:** Show you can **design and operate systems** that make the firm sharper and more credible to LPs; be meticulous.

If you’d like, next step I can:

- Turn this into a **one-page battle card per person**, and
- Draft **2–3 custom opening lines / questions** for each, tuned to how *you* talk.
