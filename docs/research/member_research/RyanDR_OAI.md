## Identity & Source Richness

**Identity resolution.**

There are many people named Ryan Sullivan, but combining **name + role + firm** yields a clear match:

- Official FirstMark team page lists **Ryan Sullivan – Investor, Enterprise Apps & Infrastructure**. ([FirstMark](https://firstmark.com/team/ryan-sullivan/))
- His prior roles at **Ansa Capital** and **M33 Growth**, plus **Summit Partners** and **UiPath**, appear consistently across FirstMark’s bio, M33’s bio, Ansa’s materials, and third-party org charts. ([FirstMark](https://firstmark.com/team/ryan-sullivan/))
- LinkedIn search snippet shows **“Investor @ FirstMark”**, **Notre Dame** education, based in **New York**. ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryansullivan-?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

I’ll treat this as the **correct individual**, with **moderate data richness**: good official bios and one extended article he co-authored, but little publicly available video / long-form speaking.

- [OBSERVATION – medium] His public footprint is **firm-centric** (bios, firm content, thought-leadership co-authorship), rather than a heavy solo social-media/personal-brand presence. This is typical for many junior-to-mid investors at established VC firms.

---

### 1.5 Affiliations, Boards, Awards & Other Signals

- [FACT – low/medium] No clear public board seats or headline awards directly attributed to him in current sources; any such roles appear to be at the **deal/firm level** rather than prominently branded as “Ryan’s” board. (This is not unusual for a relatively early-career investor.)
- [FACT – medium] Associated with **Ansa’s “Open Spaces” thought leadership series** and AI/security themes, suggesting involvement in that community of founders and operators. ([newsletter.ansa.co](https://newsletter.ansa.co/p/winter-2024))
- [FACT – medium] Web3.bio / Farcaster profile lists him as **“Investor at Ansa Capital”** and aggregates his on-chain/Web3 identity—indicating at least some interest in modern tech ecosystems beyond traditional VC. ([Web3.bio](https://web3.bio/ryansullivan.farcaster))

---

### 1.6 Evidence Quality & Gaps

- [FACT – high] **Core identity & roles** are well-supported by **official firm bios (FirstMark, M33, Ansa)** and third-party org charts. ([FirstMark](https://firstmark.com/team/ryan-sullivan/))
- [OBSERVATION – medium] **Richest text sample** is the **AI model security article** (co-authored) plus his M33 bio; these give some signal on how he structures ideas and what he cares about. ([Ansa](https://www.ansa.co/insight/ai-model-security-in-the-age-of-generative-ai?utm_campaign=the-latest-from-ansa&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=newsletter.ansa.co))
- [OBSERVATION – medium] **Sparse video/podcast data:** I didn’t find clear, named talks or panels featuring him personally (as opposed to general FirstMark content). That limits direct evidence on real-time communication style.
- [HYPOTHESIS – low] Gaps: we have limited visibility into how he interacts live with founders in meetings, how sharp/pointed his questioning is, and his internal status at FirstMark beyond formal titles.

---

# PART 2 – PROFILE ANALYSIS

### Evidence & Confidence Overview

- **Data richness:** **Moderate.** Strong, consistent bios and one substantial article; limited direct video/audio.
- **Breadth vs. depth:** Views are built on a **few high-quality sources** (FirstMark bio, M33 bio, Ansa materials, MAD article credits) plus some surrounding ecosystem context.
- **Caveats:**
  - When I comment on **how he thinks or interviews**, that’s mostly **inferred** from: his sector focus, the nature of his written work (AI security piece), and the culture of FirstMark / Ansa.
  - All such items are clearly labeled as **[HYPOTHESIS]** with confidence levels.

---

## 2.1 Professional Identity & Self-Positioning

- [OBSERVATION – medium] **“Enterprise / infra-savvy investor with an automation background.”**
  - His career path moves from **building RPA workflows at UiPath**, to **growth equity investing at Summit & M33**, to **Ansa & FirstMark** with strong themes around enterprise software, cybersecurity, and AI. ([m33growth.com](https://www.m33growth.com/ryan-sullivan))
- [OBSERVATION – medium] **Pattern: “systematizer of investing.”**
  - FirstMark’s bio calling out **company scoring models** and a **custom workflow automation platform** suggests he likes to **formalize and codify** how investing work gets done (e.g., scoring frameworks, automation around pipeline). ([FirstMark](https://firstmark.com/team/ryan-sullivan/))
- [HYPOTHESIS – medium] He likely sees himself as a **bridge** between:
  - Technical/product detail (RPA, AI model security, infra), and
  - Repeatable investment process (scoring models, internal platforms).

        This would align with his mix of **Finance + CS/Computing** education and his career choices.

- [HYPOTHESIS – medium] He probably identifies more as an **“enterprise builder / enabler”** than a pure financial engineer—the Ansa article emphasizes how security infrastructure unlocks AI adoption, not just valuations. ([Ansa](https://www.ansa.co/insight/ai-model-security-in-the-age-of-generative-ai?utm_campaign=the-latest-from-ansa&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=newsletter.ansa.co))

---

## 2.2 Cognitive & Working Style

- [OBSERVATION – medium] **Structured, categorical thinker.**
  - The AI model security article is organized into **problem framing → historical analogies → threat taxonomy → opportunity buckets**, with clear bulletized lists (attack methods, tooling categories, etc.). ([Ansa](https://www.ansa.co/insight/ai-model-security-in-the-age-of-generative-ai?utm_campaign=the-latest-from-ansa&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=newsletter.ansa.co))
- [OBSERVATION – medium] **Comfortable with both qualitative and quantitative reasoning.**
  - Experience building **scoring models** and **workflow automation** + a Finance/Computing background points to comfort with **models, metrics, and process design**, not just narratives. ([FirstMark](https://firstmark.com/team/ryan-sullivan/))
- [HYPOTHESIS – medium] **Big-picture first, then drill down.**
  - The security article starts with macro patterns (BYOD → CrowdStrike; cloud → Zscaler; IAM examples) and then narrows into specific vectors and tool categories. This suggests he likes to situate a problem in a **historical/market frame** before discussing specific architectures or products. ([Ansa](https://www.ansa.co/insight/ai-model-security-in-the-age-of-generative-ai?utm_campaign=the-latest-from-ansa&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=newsletter.ansa.co))
- [HYPOTHESIS – low/medium] **Bias toward operationalizable frameworks.**
  - His history building automation and scoring systems implies he’s likely drawn to frameworks that **can be encoded into workflows or software**, not just slideware.

---

## 2.3 Communication & Interaction Style

(He doesn’t have much public speaking content, so this section is more inferential.)

- [OBSERVATION – medium] **Written style: clear, businesslike, and example-driven.**
  - The AI model security piece uses **plain but precise language**, with concrete examples and relatively little jargon for a technical topic—suggesting he aims for **clarity over theatrics**. ([Ansa](https://www.ansa.co/insight/ai-model-security-in-the-age-of-generative-ai?utm_campaign=the-latest-from-ansa&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=newsletter.ansa.co))
- [OBSERVATION – low/medium] **Tone: analytical, not hype-y.**
  - The piece acknowledges both **opportunity and risk** of AI, enumerates attack surfaces and compliance standards, and talks about “step-function increases in demand” without over-promising. That’s typical of a **VC who wants credibility with technical buyers**. ([Ansa](https://www.ansa.co/insight/ai-model-security-in-the-age-of-generative-ai?utm_campaign=the-latest-from-ansa&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=newsletter.ansa.co))
- [HYPOTHESIS – medium] In an interview, he’s likely to ask **direct, structured questions** (“walk me through how you…”) and expect **equally structured answers**, but not necessarily in a confrontational style.
- [HYPOTHESIS – low] Given his relatively early but serious career profile (and absence of strong personal-brand content), he probably leans toward **professional, slightly reserved** rather than flashy or highly informal in first meetings.

---

## 2.4 Values, Motivations & Incentives

- [OBSERVATION – medium] **Values infrastructure that unlocks adoption.**
  - The security article repeatedly frames security tooling as an *enabler* of AI adoption (“we’re focused on this opportunity for new players to innovate in AI model security… enabling widespread adoption”). ([Ansa](https://www.ansa.co/insight/ai-model-security-in-the-age-of-generative-ai?utm_campaign=the-latest-from-ansa&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=newsletter.ansa.co))
- [OBSERVATION – medium] **Appreciates rigor & robustness.**
  - Attention to compliance standards (FIPS, PCI-DSS), monitoring, governance, and specific attack vectors indicates a **serious approach to risk**, not just growth at all costs. ([Ansa](https://www.ansa.co/insight/ai-model-security-in-the-age-of-generative-ai?utm_campaign=the-latest-from-ansa&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=newsletter.ansa.co))
- [HYPOTHESIS – medium] Likely values **builders who understand second-order effects**—e.g., “if we wire AI into core workflows, what breaks? what needs to be secured? how do we monitor it?”
- [HYPOTHESIS – medium] Motivated by **helping founders “operationalize” AI and infra**—his role at FirstMark plus contributions to the MAD landscape (a large structured map of AI/data categories) suggest he likes **mapping messy spaces and then backing the right nodes.** ([FirstMark](https://firstmark.com/story/bubble-build-the-2025-mad-machine-learning-ai-data-landscape/))

---

## 2.5 Interviewer Mindset & Likely Evaluation Lens (AI Builder Context)

- [HYPOTHESIS – medium] **Lens: “Can this person actually build robust AI systems that matter to enterprise customers and our firm?”**
  - Given his enterprise/infrastructure focus and exposure to AI security, expect him to evaluate whether you **understand real constraints** (security, governance, data quality, operational reliability) as much as you understand clever prompts.
- [HYPOTHESIS – medium] **Non-negotiables likely include:**
  - **Technical credibility** around LLM/AI system design (agents, retrieval, infra basics).
  - **Security & reliability awareness**—you appreciate attack vectors, data leakage risk, and operational issues.
  - **Ability to systematize** your work: how you’d create reusable workflows, internal tools, and metrics, not just one-off projects.
  - **Enterprise empathy:** you understand how AI plugs into existing processes and SaaS tools rather than assuming a clean slate.
- [HYPOTHESIS – low/medium] He may also test whether you **speak the same language as growth/VC investors**—you can articulate value in terms of **unit economics, time-to-value, defensibility, and wedge/expansion strategy** for AI tools across FirstMark’s portfolio.

---

## 2.6 Limits & Alternative Readings

- [HYPOTHESIS – low] Some of the article’s structure and themes may be driven more by **firm style (Ansa)** or co-author **Allan Jean-Baptiste** than by Ryan personally. So we shouldn’t over-fit on the style of that one piece. ([newsletter.ansa.co](https://newsletter.ansa.co/p/winter-2024))
- [HYPOTHESIS – low] His contributions to the MAD landscape might be **operational/design-oriented (blog/UX)** rather than analytical; we know he was thanked for “blog refresh,” not necessarily co-authoring the analysis. ([FirstMark](https://firstmark.com/story/bubble-build-the-2025-mad-machine-learning-ai-data-landscape/))
- [HYPOTHESIS – low] Without recorded interviews, his **live demeanor** could range from warm and conversational to fairly terse—even with the same underlying thinking style. So anything about “how friendly” or “how tough” he is in the room is speculative.

---

# PART 3 – INTERVIEW BRIEFING (AI BUILDER @ FIRSTMARK)

Below is concrete guidance tailored to **you interviewing as an AI Builder** with **Ryan Sullivan** as one of your interviewers.

---

## 3.1 Likely Interview Goals & Angles

- [OBSERVATION – medium] **From the role:**
  - The AI Builder role is about **designing and implementing AI workflows and agentic systems** across FirstMark (investing, platform, back office) and potentially the portfolio.
  - As an **Investor focused on enterprise apps & infrastructure**, Ryan’s job is to spot scalable, robust systems that actually work in an enterprise environment. ([FirstMark](https://firstmark.com/team/))
- [HYPOTHESIS – medium] **Primary things he’s likely assessing:**
    1. **Can you design AI systems that are production-worthy in enterprise contexts?**
    2. **Do you understand security, observability, and reliability enough not to embarrass the firm or portfolio?** (informed by his AI security work). ([Ansa](https://www.ansa.co/insight/ai-model-security-in-the-age-of-generative-ai?utm_campaign=the-latest-from-ansa&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=newsletter.ansa.co))
    3. **Can you work with investors and founders as a partner—translating between technical detail and business value?**
    4. **Will you build reusable, systematized workflows**, not a trail of cool but one-off hacky demos (echoing his history with scoring models & automation platforms). ([FirstMark](https://firstmark.com/team/ryan-sullivan/))

---

## 3.2 Likely Question Themes & Probes

Below are **probable themes** and how they might show up in his questions.

1. **End-to-end AI system design in messy environments**
    - Why: This is exactly where enterprise apps & infra live.
    - Expect questions like:
        - “Walk me through an AI system you built from scratch—data flows, models, infra, and failure modes.”
        - “How does it integrate with existing tools / workflows?”
    - What he’s looking for: clear architecture, realistic constraints, and acknowledgment of trade-offs (latency, cost, reliability).
2. **Security, safety, and governance**
    - Why: He’s written about AI model security threats and tooling categories. ([Ansa](https://www.ansa.co/insight/ai-model-security-in-the-age-of-generative-ai?utm_campaign=the-latest-from-ansa&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=newsletter.ansa.co))
    - Expect probes like:
        - “What are the main security risks in the systems you’re proposing?”
        - “How would you prevent data leakage / prompt injection / model abuse?”
    - Good answers will mention: isolation boundaries, RBAC, logging, guardrails, evaluation, and vendor risk—not just “we sanitize prompts.”
3. **Systematization & internal platforms**
    - Why: He has history building scoring models and workflow automation platforms. ([FirstMark](https://firstmark.com/team/ryan-sullivan/))
    - Expect:
        - “If you build one useful workflow, how do you generalize it so others can reuse it?”
        - “What internal tools or abstractions would you create for the firm?”
4. **Impact & ROI for FirstMark and portfolio**
    - Why: As an investor, his mental model is “does this create durable value?”
    - Expect:
        - “Which use cases would you prioritize first and why?”
        - “How do we know this AI workflow is worth the time vs. hiring another associate / analyst?”
5. **Market and infra awareness**
    - Why: He sits inside a firm that publishes the MAD landscape—he’s immersed in the vendor ecosystem. ([FirstMark](https://firstmark.com/story/bubble-build-the-2025-mad-machine-learning-ai-data-landscape/))
    - Expect:
        - “Which infra/tools would you build on vs. buy?”
        - “Where do you think the most durable value is in the AI stack right now?”
6. **Collaboration with founders & teams**
    - Why: AI Builder will interact with portfolio companies; he will care that you’re not a lone-wolf.
    - Expect:
        - “Tell me about a time a founder / stakeholder strongly disagreed with your technical approach. How did you handle it?”

---

## 3.3 How to Engage & Build Rapport

**DOs**

1. **Lead with structure.**
    - Start answers with a **quick framework** (“I’ll cover goal → constraints → architecture → risks → metrics”) and then drill down. This matches the structured, categorical style in his published work. [HYPOTHESIS – medium]
2. **Make your systems legible to an investor.**
    - Translate technical design into **business outcomes**:
        - “This workflow saves X hours per deal, reduces errors by Y%, and gives us new data that improves scoring by Z.”
3. **Show security & reliability awareness without fear-mongering.**
    - Acknowledge realistic threats (prompt injection, data leakage, model drift) and briefly outline **practical mitigations** (RBAC, logging, eval harnesses, red-teaming). Reference concrete experiences, not just theory.
4. **Speak in categories & examples.**
    - When talking AI tooling, organize into categories (infra vs. agent framework vs. orchestration vs. evaluation), then name specific tools you’ve used. That mirrors how the MAD map is structured. ([FirstMark](https://firstmark.com/story/bubble-build-the-2025-mad-machine-learning-ai-data-landscape/))
5. **Ask him thoughtful questions about portfolio and infra.**
    - Good topics:
        - “Where do you see the biggest bottlenecks in FirstMark’s internal workflows today?”
        - “Which portfolio AI tools have really impressed you—what made them stand out?”

**DON’Ts**

1. **Don’t hand-wave about “agents” or “autonomy” without architecture.**
    - He’s used to hearing hype; you’ll stand out by grounding in **concrete system diagrams and failure modes**. [HYPOTHESIS – medium]
2. **Don’t ignore security, compliance, or monitoring.**
    - Given his AI model security focus, completely skipping this will read as **naïve**. Better to acknowledge it and show you know how to layer it in. ([Ansa](https://www.ansa.co/insight/ai-model-security-in-the-age-of-generative-ai?utm_campaign=the-latest-from-ansa&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=newsletter.ansa.co))
3. **Don’t talk only in terms of isolated proofs-of-concept.**
    - Continually connect back to **repeatability** (“here’s how I’d templatize this for multiple teams / funds / portfolio companies”).

---

## 3.4 Risk Areas & Missteps to Avoid

- [HYPOTHESIS – medium] **Over-indexing on model cleverness, under-indexing on systems and process.**
  - Danger: talking only about “I used GPT-4 with this clever prompt” and not about **data, orchestration, observability, and integration**.
- [HYPOTHESIS – medium] **Ignoring enterprise reality.**
  - If you assume greenfield infra instead of integrating with existing CRM, data warehouse, and security posture, you may appear out of touch with the portfolio contexts he sees daily.
- [HYPOTHESIS – low/medium] **Sounding dismissive of security / governance.**
  - Even subtle “we’ll worry about that later” language may clash with his security-aware mindset. Better to say “here’s the MVP, and here’s how we’d harden it over time.” ([Ansa](https://www.ansa.co/insight/ai-model-security-in-the-age-of-generative-ai?utm_campaign=the-latest-from-ansa&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=newsletter.ansa.co))
- [HYPOTHESIS – low] **Being vague about impact.**
  - High-level claims like “this will save tons of time” without concrete estimates or a measurement plan will land poorly with someone who builds scoring models and automation platforms to quantify things. ([FirstMark](https://firstmark.com/team/ryan-sullivan/))

---

## 3.5 Tailored Preparation Checklist

**Architecture & Systems**

- Prepare **2–3 concrete case studies** of AI/LLM systems you’ve built, each with:
  - Goal, users, and business outcome.
  - Data sources & prep; model(s) and orchestration; tools used; infra choices.
  - Failure modes, monitoring, and how you’d harden or scale it.
- Sketch at least one **“FirstMark AI Builder” system**:
  - e.g., an **AI-assisted deal triage / memo draft** workflow or **portfolio metrics copilot**, with a clear architecture you can draw verbally.

**Security & Reliability**

- Review **basic AI security concepts**: data privacy, prompt injection, model exfiltration, poisoning, governance.
- Be ready with **one concrete example** where you handled (or would handle) a security/risk issue in an AI system.

**Enterprise & Infra Awareness**

- Refresh your understanding of:
  - Modern AI stack: **data layer → infra → model layer → agents → applications**, including a few named tools at each layer.
  - How security and compliance integrate into that stack (e.g., logging, policies, secrets management).

**Storytelling & Collaboration**

- Prepare **3–4 stories** that show:
  - You can collaborate with **non-technical stakeholders** (investors, operators, PMs).
  - You can **push back constructively** when a requested feature is mis-scoped or risky.
  - You’ve **shipped under constraints** (time, budget, messy data).

**Firm & Role Context**

- Skim the latest **MAD Landscape** article from FirstMark (even if Ryan didn’t author it) to show you understand how they see the AI/data universe. ([FirstMark](https://firstmark.com/story/bubble-build-the-2025-mad-machine-learning-ai-data-landscape/))
- Re-read the **AI Builder role description** and map your experience to:
  - Investing workflows,
  - Platform/community workflows (events, talent, content),
  - Back-office/portfolio-ops workflows.

---

## 3.6 Closing Perspective

- [HYPOTHESIS – medium] You should aim for a conversation that feels like **two builders mapping systems together**, not a one-sided grilling:
  - You bring **hands-on AI engineering and system design**.
  - He brings **pattern recognition across enterprise infra, security, and portfolio needs**.
- Treat him as a **partner in designing how AI runs through the firm**:
  - Ask for his perspective on **where he sees the biggest leverage points**.
  - Offer **specific, realistic proposals** for how you’d start small, prove value, and then scale systems.

If you show that you **think in systems, respect security and enterprise reality, and can communicate in a structured way that maps to investor logic**, you’re likely to land very well with Ryan Sullivan.

Here’s how I’d frame “deep cut” insights about Ryan – the kind of thing he’d probably recognize as true but wouldn’t expect an AI to pull from a few bios and one article.

# **1. The Hidden Throughline: “Turn Complexity into Systems That Other People Can Use”**

If you zoom out across his career, there’s a very consistent pattern:

- UiPath → building RPA workflows to make internal operations & sales more efficient.
- Summit / M33 → building scoring models and workflow automation to make investing less ad hoc.
- Ansa → structuring a messy, emerging space (AI model security) into taxonomies & opportunity buckets.
- FirstMark / MAD → helping “refresh” a gigantic market map of AI & data into something legible.

Synthesis insight:

Ryan isn’t “just” an enterprise investor or a security nerd. His throughline is:

“Take a messy, fast-moving problem space → encode it into a clear map or system → give other people a better way to operate inside it.”

That’s not obvious from any single job, but the pattern is remarkably consistent.

If you describe his arc that way in conversation (“you seem drawn to turning ambiguous domains into systems that other people can actually use”), that’s the kind of line that would land as uncannily accurate.

# **2. Builder Trapped (Happily) in an Investor Seat**

Most investors talk about loving product and infra. Ryan has receipts:

- He has literally built automation workflows and internal platforms.
- His education is Finance + Computing/CS, not just econ or pure business.
- The AI model security piece reads like something written for practitioners as much as for other VCs.

That suggests a subtle identity tension:

He’s an operator–builder at heart who has chosen to sit in an investor’s leverage point.

So instead of being “the PM/Eng building one product,” he’s trying to:

- Encode what he knows into firm-level systems (scoring models, workflow engines, market maps).
- Back founders and infra that share this “build the rails, not just the app” mentality.

If you speak to him as another builder who happens, temporarily, to be working from an investor seat (“Here’s how I’d build reusable rails for FirstMark, not just one-off tools”), you’re aligning with that deeper identity, not just his title.

# **3. His Edge Bet: Infrastructure for the “Second Wave” of AI**

Look at the timing and topics he’s gravitated toward:

- Early RPA (UiPath) → “make repetitive work programmable.”
- Growth equity & B2B SaaS (Summit/M33) → “software as the operating layer for businesses.”
- AI model security & infra (Ansa, FirstMark) → “what has to exist for AI to be trusted and adopted at scale.”

This reads less like random job-hopping and more like a coherent thesis:

Wave 1: Software eats manual workflows.

Wave 2: AI eats software workflows.

Ryan’s niche: Fund and build the infrastructure that lets Wave 2 actually ship, be secure, and not blow up.

He looks very intentionally positioned as one of the “next-gen infra investors” whose edge is understanding both the AI magic and the unsexy plumbing (security, governance, data, workflow).

Framing your work as “second-wave infra” (“I’m building the connective tissue that lets AI actually live inside real firms”) is speaking directly to that thesis, even if it’s not written down anywhere.

# **4. His Evaluation Lens: “Could I Turn This Into a Playbook?”**

Because his instinct is to turn messy things into systems, his implicit filter on people is likely:

“If I gave this person a fuzzy, high-value problem, could they turn it into a reusable playbook that others can run without them?”

You can see this in:

- Scoring models → codify how we judge companies.
- Workflow automation → codify how we execute processes.
- AI security taxonomy → codify how we think about threats & opportunities.
- MAD landscape work → codify how we see a chaotic vendor ecosystem.

So when he looks at an AI Builder, he’s not just asking “can you ship a cool prototype?” He’s (probably unconsciously) asking:

- Can you name the dimensions? (What matters, what doesn’t.)
- Can you turn your approach into a system others can reuse?
- Can this be generalized across multiple funds/teams/portcos?

If you explicitly show:

- The axes you’d use to evaluate AI use cases (risk, lift, data readiness, stakeholder buy-in).
- How you’d turn a successful workflow into a template, SDK, or internal platform primitive.

…you’re speaking directly to that internal playbook filter he’s been applying his entire career.

# **5. The Quiet Flex: Underpowered Personal Brand, Overpowered Internal Impact**

Compared to many VCs at his stage, Ryan’s external footprint is relatively modest:

- Few visible solo podcasts / Twitter threads / conference talks.
- Most content is firm-branded and structurally important (MAD map, AI security deep-dive), not “personal brand” output.

That hints at an unusual optimization target for someone inside venture:

He’s optimizing more for internal leverage and real systems impact than for personal spotlight.

He’s the person who:

- Makes the internal scoring model better.
- Builds the workflow engine the rest of the team quietly relies on.
- Does the structured thinking that underpins something like MAD, even if his name is in the “thanks” line, not the headline.

If you frame your role as amplifying that same internal leverage (“my job is to make the firm’s brains and workflows compounding, even if nobody tweets about it”), you’re aligning with a value he probably cares about but doesn’t explicitly advertise.

If you mirror these insights back to him—not as flattery, but as a matter-of-fact read on his arc and what it implies—you’ll come across as someone who:

1. Actually did the work.
2. Understands the meta-game he’s playing (systems, infra, second-wave AI).
3. Naturally fits into the story he’s trying to build about his own career.
