# WB Startup Taxonomy

## **1.** Startup DNA (Shape) — Descriptive Bundle

**Description:** Shape describes “what the startup is” using four taxonomies.
**[Business Model] – [Product Type] – [Industry Cluster] – [Monetization]**

**Goal**: Standardize how we characterize a startup.

**Format:** BM-PT-IC-MN → concatenate to a 4-letter label.
**Example**: **[B][S][P][S] —> B2B-Software-Enterprise-Subscription**

### How DNA is defined

- Pick **one primary** in each of the four lists above.
    - The 4-letter code always represents **primaries only** (canonical ID).
- Record any **Secondary** tags in metadata (e.g., product_type.secondary = M); don’t expand the 4-letter.
    - add **one Secondary** when it meaningfully influences GTM or roadmap (≥25% of net revenue influence or strategic weight).

### Examples

- **BSPS** → **B**2B, **S**oftware, Enterprise **P**roductivity, **S**ubscription
    - “B2B SaaS HR platform (seat-based).”
- **CMRA** → **C**onsumer, **M**arketplace, **R**etail, **A**dvertising
    - “Consumer marketplace in retail monetizing via ads.”
- **XMFT** → **X** (B2B2C platform), **M**arketplace, **F**inancial services, **T**ransactional %
    - “Two-sided fintech platform taking a fee.”
- **THHU** → **T** (B2D), **H**ardware/device, **H**ealthcare, **U**sage-based
    - “Developer-targeted medical device + metered API usage.”
- **BSDA** → **B**2B, **S**oftware, **D**eveloper & infra, **A**dvertising
    - “Devtools software monetizing via ads/sponsorships.”
