Leveraging the latest in LLM technologies, their platform enables workflows to be completely traceable and dynamic, allowing a reviewer to ask validating questions of the medical records themselves, and link back to the original source.  This innovation represents a massive step forward for payment integrity, allowing claims to be reviewed 20x faster than traditional workflows. And, because reviews can now be done more efficiently, lower dollar claims can be analyzed as well, bringing transparency to more of the market.",
