# Agno - AI Agents for Engineers

> https://agno.com

Agno is an open-source platform for building, shipping, and monitoring AI agent systems. Built for engineers who need production-ready agents with memory, knowledge, and reasoning capabilities.

## What is Agno?

Agno is a Python framework for building multi-agent systems with shared memory, knowledge, and reasoning. It provides:

- **Agent Framework**: Turn any LLM into an agent with tools, memory, and knowledge
- **Workspaces**: Full infrastructure (database, vector storage, API) for production deployment
- **Monitoring**: Track performance, optimize, and evaluate your agents
- **Multi-Agent Teams**: Coordinate multiple agents working toward common goals
- **Model Agnostic**: Works with any model provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Ollama, etc.)
- **No Lock-in**: Use any database, vector store, or infrastructure

## Key Features

**Memory & Knowledge**
- Built-in long-term memory for personalized conversations
- Knowledge integration from documents, websites, APIs
- Session storage and state management
- Agentic RAG with vector database support

**Agent Development**
- Production-ready templates and examples
- Structured outputs with Pydantic models
- Tool integration (web search, APIs, databases)
- Human-in-the-loop workflows
- Async/sync support

**Multi-Agent Systems**
- Agent teams and workflows
- Coordinated reasoning and collaboration
- Task distribution and load balancing
- Deterministic, stateful programs in pure Python

**Production Ready**
- Deploy to any cloud (AWS, GCP, Railway, Render, Modal)
- Built-in monitoring and evaluation
- Hallucination detection and quality metrics
- Performance optimization and scaling

## Use Cases

- **Customer Support**: Intelligent help desk automation
- **Financial Analysis**: Market research and data analysis agents
- **Legal Review**: Document analysis and compliance checking
- **Revenue Operations**: Sales enrichment and lead qualification
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Market analysis and research
- **Product Testing**: Automated QA and testing workflows
- **Growth Marketing**: Content generation and campaign optimization

## Getting Started

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    description="AI assistant with web search capabilities",
    instructions="Always search for current information and cite sources"
)

agent.print_response("What are the latest AI trends in 2025?")
```
