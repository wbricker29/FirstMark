# Company Description Workflow

> A workflow that generates comprehensive supplier profiles by gathering information from multiple sources and delivers them via email.

## Overview

This workflow combines web crawling, search engines, Wikipedia, and competitor analysis to create detailed supplier profiles. It processes company information through 4 specialized agents running in parallel, then generates a structured markdown report and sends it via email.

The workflow uses workflow session state management to cache analysis results. If the same supplier is analyzed again, it returns cached results instead of re-running the expensive analysis pipeline.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* OpenAI API key
* Resend API key for emails \[[https://resend.com/api-keys](https://resend.com/api-keys)]
* Firecrawl API key for web crawling \[[https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/api-keys](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/api-keys)]

### Quick Setup

```bash  theme={null}
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
export RESEND_API_KEY="your-resend-key"
export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY="your-firecrawl-key"
```

Install dependencies

```
pip install agno openai firecrawl-py resend
```

## Code Structure

This company description workflow consists of three main files:

### 1. Agents (`agents.py`)

Specialized agents for gathering information from multiple sources:

## Usage Example

```python  theme={null}
# Create supplier profile request
supplier_request = SupplierProfile(
    supplier_name="Your Company Name",
    supplier_homepage_url="https://yourcompany.com",
    user_email="your.email@company.com",
)

# Run the workflow
company_description_workflow.print_response(
