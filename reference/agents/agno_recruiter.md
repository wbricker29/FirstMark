Employee Recruitment Workflow with Simulated Tools

This workflow automates the complete employee recruitment process from resume screening
to interview scheduling and email communication. It demonstrates a multi-agent system
working together to handle different aspects of the hiring pipeline.

Workflow Overview:

1. **Resume Screening**: Analyzes candidate resumes against job requirements and scores them
2. **Interview Scheduling**: Schedules interviews for qualified candidates (score >= 5.0)
3. **Email Communication**: Sends professional interview invitation emails

Key Features:

* **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Uses specialized agents for screening, scheduling, and email writing
* **Async Streaming**: Provides real-time feedback during execution
* **Simulated Tools**: Uses mock Zoom scheduling and email sending for demonstration
* **Resume Processing**: Extracts text from PDF resumes via URLs
* **Structured Responses**: Uses Pydantic models for type-safe data handling
* **Session State**: Caches resume content to avoid re-processing

Agents:

* **Screening Agent**: Evaluates candidates and provides scores/feedback
* **Scheduler Agent**: Creates interview appointments with realistic time slots
* **Email Writer Agent**: Composes professional interview invitation emails
* **Email Sender Agent**: Handles email delivery (simulated)

Usage:
python employee\_recruiter\_async\_stream.py

Input Parameters:

* message: Instructions for the recruitment process
* candidate\_resume\_urls: List of PDF resume URLs to process
* job\_description: The job posting requirements and details

Output:

* Streaming updates on each phase of the recruitment process
* Candidate screening results with scores and feedback
* Interview scheduling confirmations
* Email delivery confirmations

Note: This workflow uses simulated tools for Zoom scheduling and email sending
to demonstrate the concept, you can use the real tools in practice.
