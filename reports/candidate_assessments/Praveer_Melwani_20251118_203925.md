### Summary

[Overall: Strong → 3.9/5] CFO fit with clear strengths in late-stage fundraising and IPO readiness; solid ops and systems chops; moderate visibility into people-leadership and GTM depth. A FirstMark partner will care most that Melwani demonstrably led an IPO and built the controls and reporting required for public markets — both supported by S-1/10-Q filings — and will want to dig into team scale, management cadence, and concrete GTM partnership examples. Upside surprises: if he provides direct metrics showing he scaled a 20–50+ person finance org and ran GTM-linked financial experiments, Team Leadership and GTM Partnership scores could move up materially; downside surprises: unresolved early-career/education gaps or weaker direct people-management anecdotes would keep leadership/GTM scores lower.

## Detailed Assessment

### Role Requirements

### Dimensions 1. Fundraising Excellence (25) 2. Strategic Finance Ops (25) 3. Team Leadership (20) 4. GTM Partnership (15) 5. Systems Modernization (15)  Must-haves: IPO prep, SaaS ARR >$50M.

### Dimension Scores

#### Fundraising Excellence (25)

**Score:** 5/5 █████
**Confidence:** High | **Evidence Level:** High

**Reasoning:**

Public SEC filings (S-1/S-1A, 10-Q) and press coverage document Figma's late-stage financing and public offering process while Melwani was CFO; these records show he led IPO readiness and was the finance lead through valuation and pricing steps. This is strong, high-reliability evidence of fundraising excellence at late stage/IPO.

**Evidence Quotes:**

> Figma Files Registration Statement for Proposed Initial Public Offering (company S-1).
> Figma, Inc. S-1/A (Amendment No. 2) — SEC archival filing.
> Reuters — Figma targets $18.8 billion valuation in US IPO.

- https://www.reuters.com/business/figma-targets-188-billion-valuation-us-ipo-after-bumping-up-price-range-2025-07-28/

#### Strategic Finance Ops (25)

**Score:** 4/5 ████░
**Confidence:** Medium | **Evidence Level:** Medium

**Reasoning:**

Multiple company disclosures and public commentary state Melwani built and scaled finance and operations, implemented internal controls and reporting integration ahead of IPO. Evidence is credible (company SEC filings, company blog) but independent case-study links referenced in the research package were not all provided, slightly limiting corroboration of operational outcomes.

**Evidence Quotes:**

> Research notes: built and scaled finance operations and integrated a unified data source for reporting and analytics.
> Figma S-1 and 10-Q filings referencing internal controls and finance processes around public reporting.

**Citations:**

- https://investor.figma.com/financials/sec-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=18754262

#### Team Leadership (20)

**Score:** 3/5 ███░░
**Confidence:** Medium | **Evidence Level:** Medium

**Reasoning:**

Public materials indicate he scaled finance & business operations from 2017 through CFO promotion and through IPO preparation, implying effective team leadership. However, granular public evidence on org size, direct people-management track record, promotion metrics, and leadership style is limited in the research package, so assessment is cautiously neutral-to-positive.

**Evidence Quotes:**

> Joined Figma in July 2017; served as Head of Business Operations & Finance and later CFO (March 2022 - Present).
> Research: 'built and scaled finance and operations functions' and 'aligned finance with cross-functional stakeholders'.

**Citations:**

- https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1579878/000162828025036090/figmas-1a2.htm

#### GTM Partnership (15)

**Score:** 3/5 ███░░
**Confidence:** Medium | **Evidence Level:** Low

**Reasoning:**

Notes claim he aligned finance with cross-functional stakeholders (GTM alignment), but the public research package contains limited concrete examples of partnering with Sales/Marketing to drive quota, pricing, or GTM experiments. Evidence supports involvement but not depth or outcomes, so score is middling.

**Evidence Quotes:**

> Research: 'Aligned finance with company mission and cross-functional stakeholders to support rapid growth.'
> Public filings and company narratives highlight finance's role in metrics and forecasting used for business decisions.

**Citations:**

- https://www.figma.com/blog/s1-public/
- https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1579878/000157987825000027/fig-20250630.htm

#### Systems Modernization (15)

**Score:** 4/5 ████░
**Confidence:** Medium | **Evidence Level:** Medium

**Reasoning:**

Research specifically cites implementation of an integrated data/reporting system and a single source of truth for reporting/analytics, and company filings describe controls and reporting readiness for public markets. Several supporting case studies were referenced in the packet but direct URLs were missing, reducing independent corroboration slightly.

**Evidence Quotes:**

> Research: 'implemented integrated data/reporting systems' and 'unified data source for reporting and analytics'.
> S-1 mentions readiness and systems improvements tied to public reporting.

**Citations:**

- https://www.figma.com/blog/s1-public/
- https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1579878/000162828025036090/figmas-1a2.htm

### Must-Haves Assessment

**IPO prep (must-have):** ✅ MET

Figma S-1, S-1/A, and 2025 10-Q filings document the company's IPO process and Melwani's role as CFO and Treasurer during IPO readiness and public filing (company blog, SEC filings).

**SaaS ARR > $50M (must-have):** ✅ MET

Public SEC filings (S-1/10-Q filings) report Figma revenue metrics consistent with ARR above $50M prior to IPO; filings and investor materials are cited in the research package.

---

## 🚨 Red Flags

- Education and early-career history not publicly verifiable — board will want primary bio and references to confirm pedigree and prior scale finance roles (research notes: education and pre-2017 roles missing).
- Incomplete external corroboration for systems/case-study claims — several referenced case studies/interviews (Ramp, Census) lacked direct URLs in the packet, limiting verification of implementation depth.
- Limited public detail on direct people leadership metrics (org size, turnover, promotions) — harder to evaluate ability to scale a finance org rapidly at a new portfolio company.
- Public-company tenure is recent (IPO executed in late 2025) — while IPO readiness is proven, multi-year public reporting and look-through operating performance post-IPO are not yet visible in the packet.
- Some cited sources in the research notes were inconsistently surfaced (LinkedIn visibility inconsistencies and missing Bloomberg/profile links) — due diligence should confirm canonical profiles and references.

## ✅ Green Flags

- Led IPO readiness and public filing processes — documented by Figma S-1 and SEC filings; demonstrates direct, recent IPO experience.
- Proven late-stage fundraising and valuation engagement — Reuters coverage and company filings document late-stage financing and valuation work.
- Built scalable finance operations and reporting infrastructure — company narrative and filings indicate intentional systems and control buildouts ahead of IPO.
- Sector and stage fit — deep exposure to enterprise SaaS and late-stage/IPO transitions, which aligns with requirements for a company scaling to/through $50M+ ARR.
- Cross-functional partnership signals — cited alignment with mission and stakeholders suggests comfort operating as a strategic business partner, useful for GTM and board interactions.

## Counterfactual Analysis

*What could change this assessment?*

- If he led a finance organization of 20+ direct reports and owned hiring/promotions through multiple scale phases, Team Leadership could move from 3→4 (ask for org charts, headcount growth, promotion examples).
- If he can show direct, documented partnership with Sales/RevOps on pricing experiments or quota/compensation design that materially impacted ARR growth, GTM Partnership could move from 3→4 (request specific cross-functional projects and KPIs).
- If he provides vendor/architecture specifics and KPIs showing the integrated data/reporting system decreased close/forecast variance or improved month-end cycle time, Systems Modernization could move from 4→5 (ask for before/after metrics and vendor list).
- If reference checks confirm sustained public-company reporting ownership with post-IPO SEC filings he personally led (10-Q/10-K cycles), Strategic Finance Ops confidence could rise and score move from 4→5 (request which filings he owned and examples of control remediation).
- If he cannot provide primary documentation for pre-2017 roles or education, partners may treat those gaps as a constraint on narrative; conversely, supplying verifiable bios or references could remove a red-flag item.
