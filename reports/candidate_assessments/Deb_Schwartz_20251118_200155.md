### Summary

[Overall: Medium–Strong] CFO fit with strengths in capital-events and scaling finance for high-growth consumer and fintech businesses; strongest on strategic finance and people leadership, with gaps around verified SaaS >$50M ARR and concrete systems modernization evidence. FirstMark partners will care most about her direct ownership of fundraising rounds and demonstrable SaaS scale (ARR/headcount/FP&A systems). If she can verify leadership of >$50M ARR P&L or concrete platform modernization (ERP/FP&A/RevOps) and provide clear dates/references, Fundraising and Systems/Scaling scores could move meaningfully higher.

- Educational background and professional qualifications (MBA/CPA, etc.) not found.
- Board and advisor roles (e.g., Lemonade listing) are not independently confirmed.

## Detailed Assessment

### Role Requirements

### Dimensions 1. Fundraising Excellence (25) 2. Strategic Finance Ops (25) 3. Team Leadership (20) 4. GTM Partnership (15) 5. Systems Modernization (15)  Must-haves: IPO prep, SaaS ARR >$50M.

### Dimension Scores

#### Fundraising Excellence (25)

**Score:** 4/5 ████░
**Confidence:** Medium | **Evidence Level:** Medium

**Reasoning:**

Research indicates direct involvement in Cameo Series C/D fundraising and investor relations work and a history of supporting capital events at Galileo (SoFi acquisition). Evidence is from secondary sources in the brief and lacks authoritative primary citations for exact round sizes and her title-involvement, so weight is medium.

**Evidence Quotes:**

> Contributed to fundraising and IR strategy for Cameo's Series C/D activity (reported >$70M involvement—needs verification).
> Prepared Galileo for exit and supported acquisition-related financial processes (SoFi acquisition, 2020).

**Citations:**

#### Strategic Finance Ops (25)

**Score:** 4/5 ████░
**Confidence:** Medium | **Evidence Level:** Medium

**Reasoning:**

Candidate is described as a strategic, KPI-driven CFO who built KPI frameworks, stronger controls and prepared finance for rapid growth and exit processes. These claims are consistent across the research but rely on summarized secondary descriptions; primary supporting documents (e.g., Cameo press releases, Galileo filings) are not provided.

**Evidence Quotes:**

> Spearheaded Cameo's financial strategy and KPI frameworks during explosive growth.
> Built and scaled finance function at Cameo, including senior hires and stronger financial controls.

**Citations:**

#### Team Leadership (20)

**Score:** 4/5 ████░
**Confidence:** Medium | **Evidence Level:** Medium

**Reasoning:**

Research explicitly states she built the finance function at Cameo and made senior hires, showing people leadership and org-building. However, org size, span of control, and concrete metrics (headcount grown, senior direct reports) are not documented, limiting confidence.

**Evidence Quotes:**

> Built and scaled finance function at Cameo, including senior hires and stronger financial controls.

**Citations:**

- https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/more-than-just-reporting-how-cfos-can-key-strategic-drivers-price#:~:text=Drivers%20www,strategy%20through%20KPIs%2C%20fostering%20healthy

#### GTM Partnership (15)

**Score:** 3/5 ███░░
**Confidence:** Low | **Evidence Level:** Low

**Reasoning:**

There are mentions of cross-functional alignment (notably with People/HR) and KPI-driven decision-making, but direct evidence of partnership with Sales/Marketing/Rev Ops or influence over pricing, go-to-market strategy, or revenue ops is thin in the provided research.

**Evidence Quotes:**

> Characterized as a strategic, data-driven CFO who emphasizes KPI-driven decision-making, cross-functional alignment (notably with People/HR).

**Citations:**

- https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/more-than-just-reporting-how-cfos-can-key-strategic-drivers-price#:~:text=Drivers%20www,strategy%20through%20KPIs%2C%20fostering%20healthy

#### Systems Modernization (15)

**Score:** 3/5 ███░░
**Confidence:** Low | **Evidence Level:** Low

**Reasoning:**

The research references stronger financial controls and scaling the finance function, implying some systems/process work. However, there is no concrete evidence of platforms implemented (ERP, FP&A tooling, RevOps stack) or a documented modernization program, so score is conservative.

**Evidence Quotes:**

> Built and scaled finance function at Cameo, including senior hires and stronger financial controls.

**Citations:**

### Must-Haves Assessment

**IPO preparation experience:** ✅ MET

Research identifies IPO-readiness work and experience preparing Galileo for exit and supporting acquisition-related processes (SoFi acquisition). Multiple mentions of pre-IPO readiness and exit support suggest relevant experience, though primary documents are not provided.

**Experience at a SaaS company with ARR > $50M:** ❌ NOT MET

No primary evidence provided that Deb led finance at a SaaS company with >$50M ARR. Cameo is a consumer/creator marketplace with reported growth, and Galileo is fintech/BaaS; neither in the research includes verified ARR figures >$50M attributable to her role.

---

## 🚨 Red Flags

- Employment record gaps and status ambiguity: authoritative LinkedIn/profile URL and exact start/end dates for Cameo/Galileo are missing — complicates reference checking and recency verification.
- Fundraising amounts and direct ownership unclear: the reported “>$70M involvement" in Cameo rounds is unverified in primary sources; can't confirm scale or leadership role in rounds.
- SaaS ARR requirement unproven: no reliable evidence that she led finance at a SaaS business with >$50M ARR — material must-have unfulfilled.
- Systems/program specifics missing: limited public detail on platforms, ERP/FP&A tooling or RevOps partnerships; hard to judge modernization depth.
- Possible status confusion in press: some secondary sources ambiguously label her 'former' vs 'current' CFO — needs confirmation to assess recency of experience.

## ✅ Green Flags

- Exit and M&A experience: documented involvement in preparing Galileo for exit and in SoFi acquisition-related finance work — demonstrates transactional and acquirer-facing experience.
- Scale-stage CFO experience: described as leading finance through rapid growth at Cameo and building senior finance hires — useful for Series B+/pre-IPO companies.
- KPI-driven, cross-functional orientation: repeatedly noted emphasis on KPIs and alignment across functions (People/HR), indicating strategic partnership skills.
- Investor relations and fundraising exposure: credited with contributing to Series C/D fundraising and IR strategy at Cameo, suggesting board/investor comfort.
- Sector fit across fintech and creator/marketplace: experience in fintech (Galileo) and consumer marketplaces (Cameo) maps to companies in adjacent portfolio categories.

## Counterfactual Analysis

*What could change this assessment?*

- If she led or owned a finance organization at a SaaS company with >$50M ARR (provide company name, year(s), and audited/board-reported ARR) — Fundraising and Strategic Finance Ops could move 4→5 and 3→4 respectively.
- If she can provide exact role-based details on Cameo Series C/D (lead negotiator, board-facing IR owner, and dollar amounts under her management) — Fundraising score could move 4→5.
- If she can document the finance tech stack and a systems modernization program (ERP migration, FP&A tooling, automated reporting, RevOps integration) with outcomes (reduced close time, forecasting accuracy) — Systems Modernization could move 3→4.
- If she provides org charts and headcount growth showing she scaled to a 10+ person finance organization with senior direct reports (controller/treasury/FP&A) — Team Leadership could move 4→5.
- If she confirms current employment status with start/end dates and provides 2–3 references (board investor, former CEO, head of HR) who can vouch for IPO-readiness work, overall confidence would move from Medium→High.
