# Assessment Report – Brittany Bagley

- **Candidate:** Brittany Bagley
- **Screen:** Mockingbird-CFO (Chief Financial Officer) Search-9
- **Assessment ID:** N/A

## Summary
- **Overall Score:** 72.0
- **Overall Confidence:** Medium

[Overall: Solid] Strong public-company CFO with M&A and investor-relations experience; limited public evidence for DTC e-commerce depth and documented fundraising leadership. FirstMark partners will value her public-company finance and exit experience (Axon, Sonos, Scout RFP→Workday). Likely upside: credible SEC-level finance, M&A exposure, and cross-sector adaptability. Likely downside: uncertain hands-on e-commerce unit-economics experience and lack of visible fundraising leadership for venture rounds.

## Dimension Deep-Dive
### Fundraising & Investor Relations

- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** CFO roles at public companies (Sonos, Axon) plus involvement in Scout RFP through acquisition indicate meaningful investor relations and M&A experience; however, there is no public evidence she personally led large private rounds ($20M+ or $50M+).
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - CFO at Sonos (~June 2021 - ~Aug 2022) — public-company investor communications role noted in press releases.
  - Joined Axon as CFO (~Aug 2022) — continuity in public-company finance leadership.
  - Managed Scout RFP finances through acquisition by Workday (2019).

### DTC/E-commerce Finance Expertise

- **Score:** 3
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** Has consumer-hardware experience as Sonos CFO (Sonos is a consumer brand with DTC/channel mix), which gives some consumer finance exposure; however, there is no public evidence of deep e-commerce/CAC-LTV optimization, Shopify/marketplace experience, or multi-year DTC finance leadership.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Served as Sonos CFO (consumer electronics / B2C hardware) — indicates exposure to consumer business models.
  - Career spans SaaS and hardware sectors, but public sources lack specifics on unit economics or e-commerce platform work.

### Operational Finance & Systems

- **Score:** 3
- **Evidence Level:** Low
- **Confidence:** Low
- **Reasoning:** As CFO of public companies she likely oversaw FP&A and reporting processes, but there is no explicit public evidence of building finance orgs from scratch, implementing ERPs (NetSuite/ERP), or leading a modern finance tech-stack transformation.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - CFO roles at Sonos and Axon imply responsibility for operational finance and reporting.
  - No press or public bio found that documents systems implementations or explicit FP&A build-outs.

### Financial Leadership Scope

- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** Holding CFO roles at Sonos and Axon (both public companies) implies leadership of sizeable finance organizations and cross-functional responsibility; however, public sources do not specify team sizes or direct reports, so exact scope is unverified.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Appointed CFO at Sonos and later at Axon — indicates senior leadership roles in large organizations.
  - Public-company CFO roles typically include oversight of multiple finance functions though team-size data is not available in the sources.

### Growth Stage Exposure

- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence Level:** High
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** Experience spans startup/scale-up (Scout RFP leading to acquisition) and public-company leadership (Sonos, Axon), demonstrating exposure to multiple growth stages and an exit event; lacks clear evidence of leading multiple companies from Series B→IPO but shows relevant stage diversity.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Scout RFP acquisition by Workday (2019) — involvement in startup exit.
  - Subsequent CFO roles at Sonos and Axon provide public-company experience and SEC-level reporting exposure.

## Must-Haves Check
| Requirement | Met | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5+ years finance leadership experience | Yes | CFO roles at Scout RFP (~2017-2019), Sonos (~2021-2022) and Axon (~2022-present) indicate multi-year finance leadership. |
| Prior Series B+ company experience | Yes | Worked at Scout RFP through acquisition (startup/scale-up) and has held CFO roles at public companies (Sonos, Axon). |
| DTC/consumer business model expertise | No | Has consumer-hardware experience as Sonos CFO (public sources), but no documented evidence of deep DTC/e-commerce metrics (CAC/LTV) or multi-year DTC finance leadership. |
| Fundraising track record ($10M+ rounds) | No | No public evidence that she led $10M+ private fundraising rounds; Scout RFP's acquisition is documented but specific fundraising leadership is not. |

## Signal Inventory
### Green Flags
- Multiple public-company CFO roles (Sonos, Axon) — demonstrates credibility with SEC reporting and investor relations (sources: BusinessWire, CFO.com).
- Experience through a successful exit (Scout RFP → Workday) — direct M&A experience and exposure to startup lifecycle (Workday press release).
- Cross-sector experience (SaaS, consumer hardware, public safety hardware/software) — suggests adaptability to different business models (candidate summary).
- Continuity of CFO roles across companies indicates board-level trust and public-company governance experience (press announcements of appointments).

### Red Flags
- Limited public evidence of direct fundraising leadership (no documentation of leading $10M+ rounds) — raises questions about VC fundraising experience (sources: press releases, Workday acquisition).
- Short/uncertain tenure timing at Sonos (~June 2021–Aug 2022) with limited public detail — could prompt partnership/fit questions (source: businesswire/press coverage).
- No public LinkedIn or detailed career narrative found — gaps in verification of early career and team sizes (research notes show missing bios).
- Limited documentation of operational finance transformations or systems implementations (ERP/NetSuite) — may be a gap for hands-on scaling finance roles (no sources found).

## Counterfactual Evidence Requests
- If she led $10M–$50M+ private rounds (or was the primary finance lead through a VC round), Fundraising & Investor Relations could move 4→5; ask for specifics of any rounds she led, investor lists, and her role in negotiations.
- If she has run DTC P&Ls and owned CAC/LTV initiatives at Sonos (or elsewhere) for 3+ years, DTC/E-commerce score could move 3→4; ask for examples of channel/unit-economics work and KPIs she owned.
- If she implemented ERP/FP&A systems (NetSuite, adaptive planning) and built finance tech stacks, Operational Finance & Systems could move 3→5; request examples of systems owned and headcount/functions hired.
- If she managed a finance organization of 10–20+ direct reports and cross-functional teams, Financial Leadership could move 4→5; request org charts and examples of direct reports and cross-functional leadership during scaling.
