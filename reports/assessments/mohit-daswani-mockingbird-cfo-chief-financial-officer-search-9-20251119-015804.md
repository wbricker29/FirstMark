# Assessment Report – Mohit Daswani

- **Candidate:** Mohit Daswani
- **Screen:** Mockingbird-CFO (Chief Financial Officer) Search-9
- **Assessment ID:** N/A

## Summary
- **Overall Score:** 68.0
- **Overall Confidence:** Medium

[Overall: Strong] Fit for a growth-stage CFO role with strengths in fundraising, investor relations, cloud/operational finance and fintech-payments expertise; significant gap on direct DTC/e-commerce finance experience. A FirstMark partner or board should weigh his clear experience leading large-scale fundraising and pre-IPO finance functions (strengths likely to help on capital markets, audit-readiness, and cloud-driven unit economics), but should probe consumer-specific unit-economics and hands-on e-commerce channel optimization — if those are uncovered in conversation the candidate's fit for a DTC CFO role could materially improve.

## Dimension Deep-Dive
### Fundraising & Investor Relations

- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence Level:** High
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** As ThoughtSpot CFO (2020–~Jul 2024) Mohit publicly led fundraising and investor engagement for large rounds (Series E+; aggregate reported >$300M) and engaged public markets/investors. Evidence includes his LinkedIn transition post and multiple referenced interviews/press; however, there is no public evidence he led an IPO or multiple $50M+ rounds as the lead across multiple companies, so score is 4 not 5.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - After almost five years at ThoughtSpot, the time has come for me to embark on a new career adventure and I am transitioning from my role as CFO to Advisor. | Mohit Daswani
  - Oversaw fundraising activity at ThoughtSpot (Series E+ activity; aggregate reporting >$300M).

### DTC/E-commerce Finance Expertise

- **Score:** 1
- **Evidence Level:** Low
- **Confidence:** High
- **Reasoning:** Public record shows sector expertise in FinTech (PayPal, Square) and Enterprise SaaS/analytics (ThoughtSpot). There is no verifiable evidence of DTC/e-commerce finance leadership, CAC/LTV work, or operating a consumer retail business model. Given absence of consumer DTC evidence, score is 1.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Sector Expertise: FinTech / Payments, Enterprise SaaS / AI analytics / Cloud analytics
  - Prior roles include senior finance leadership at Square (circa 2017–2019) and finance leadership at PayPal around the time of its 2015 spinout from eBay.

### Operational Finance & Systems

- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** As ThoughtSpot CFO he led the company's cloud transition, focused on audit-readiness and data-driven finance, and gave public presentations about finance alignment to product/cloud strategy — indicating strong FP&A and finance transformation experience. However, explicit evidence of building finance org from scratch or implementing specific ERP/NetSuite at scale is not documented, so score is 4.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Led ThoughtSpot’s cloud migration and articulated cloud strategy publicly (CIO Dive / IPO Edge).
  - Public-facing interviews indicate a finance leader focused on audit-readiness, data-driven decision making, and aligning finance with product and cloud strategy.

### Financial Leadership Scope

- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** Holding the CFO role at a pre-IPO/scale company for ~4.5 years implies cross-functional and team leadership responsibility. Public speaking and board/advisory listings further support leadership scope. However, public documents lack explicit team-size metrics (e.g., headcount 10–20 or 20+), so score is 4 (strong) rather than 5.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Chief Financial Officer (CFO) at ThoughtSpot (Jan 2020 - Jul 2024 (approx.))
  - Board Member / Finance Committee (advisor) at Centana Growth Partners (Jan 2018 (listed) - Present)

### Growth Stage Exposure

- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence Level:** High
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** Mohit has clear experience across growth stages: at PayPal around a major corporate spinout period, senior finance at Square during high-growth/post-IPO scaling, and CFO at ThoughtSpot during Series E and cloud/scale/pre-IPO activity. He has not, however, publicly led multiple companies from Series B→IPO himself, so score is 4 rather than 5.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Stage Exposure: Growth-stage startups and scale-ups, Pre-IPO (ThoughtSpot at scale/pre-IPO context during tenure), Post-IPO / large-cap fintech (Square role during post-IPO growth)

## Must-Haves Check
| Requirement | Met | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5+ years finance leadership experience | Yes | CFO at ThoughtSpot (Jan 2020–~Jul 2024) plus senior finance roles at Square and PayPal (multiple years). LinkedIn transition post. |
| Prior Series B+ company experience | Yes | ThoughtSpot (Series E) and Square (public/post-IPO growth) indicate Series B+ exposure. |
| DTC/consumer business model expertise | No | No public evidence of DTC or consumer finance leadership; sector expertise is FinTech and Enterprise SaaS. |
| Fundraising track record ($10M+ rounds) | Yes | Public reporting indicates oversight of Series E+ activity and aggregate fundraising >$300M while CFO at ThoughtSpot. |

## Signal Inventory
### Green Flags
- Proven fundraising & investor engagement at scale — ThoughtSpot Series E+ activity and reported aggregate >$300M while CFO (LinkedIn, referenced press).
- Strong FinTech/payments pedigree (PayPal, Square) — useful for consumer payments or commerce-adjacent businesses.
- Operational focus on cloud migration, audit-readiness and data-driven finance at ThoughtSpot (public interviews/conference bios referenced).
- Public-facing communicator and thought leader (MIT Sloan CFO Summit, CIO Dive, CFO.com Q&A referenced) — helpful for investor/board-facing roles.

### Red Flags
- No public evidence of DTC/e-commerce experience — material mismatch for a pure DTC CFO role (supports score: DTC expertise = 1).
- Some profile-level claims (e.g., 'tripling revenues at Square') are not independently documented in provided sources — verify before relying on growth-impact claims.
- Board/advisory roles and exact dates are sourced to secondary profiles/aggregators; direct press/SEC confirmation is limited and should be validated.
- Key operational details (team sizes, specific ERP/NetSuite implementations, concrete revenue figures at ThoughtSpot) are not publicly documented in the materials provided.

## Counterfactual Evidence Requests
- If Mohit has led finance for a consumer-facing business or an e-commerce P&L (with documented CAC/LTV optimization), DTC/E-commerce score could move from 1 → 4.
- If he can produce org charts showing he built/managed a 10–20 person finance organization and led an ERP/NetSuite implementation, Financial Leadership and Operational Finance scores could move from 4 → 5.
- If there is authoritative public evidence he led an IPO or was the primary finance leader through an IPO at another company, Fundraising & Investor Relations and Growth Stage Exposure could move from 4 → 5.
- If the 'tripled revenues at Square' claim is corroborated with primary sources (SEC filings or company reports showing his direct contribution), Growth and Fundraising-related reasoning would strengthen (confidence ↑).
