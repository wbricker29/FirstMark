# Assessment Report – Praveer Melwani

- **Candidate:** Praveer Melwani
- **Screen:** Pigment-CFO (Chief Financial Officer) Search-8
- **Assessment ID:** N/A

## Summary
- **Overall Score:** 76.0
- **Overall Confidence:** Medium

[Overall: Solid] Strong candidate for a late-stage / pre-IPO or public SaaS CFO role — clear strengths in capital markets experience and systems modernization, with reasonable evidence of strategic finance execution. FirstMark partners/boards will likely value his IPO and finance-data experience; key open questions are about the scale of teams he’s run, direct attribution for fundraising deals, and confirmed ARR figures (these could move his Leadership and Fundraising scores materially).

## Dimension Deep-Dive
### Fundraising Excellence (25)

- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence Level:** High
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** Public records and reporting place Melwani as CFO/Treasurer during Figma’s late-stage financing activity and through the company’s IPO; that implies direct stewardship of fundraising and capital markets work, but independent press does not extensively attribute deal-level leadership to him personally.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - [FACT – high] Listed as CFO and Treasurer of Figma in public filings and coverage (role during IPO).
  - [OBSERVATION] Bloomberg podcast (Oct 2024) discusses finance's role in scaling freemium→enterprise at Figma.

### Strategic Finance Ops (25)

- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** Case study / vendor materials and LinkedIn posts document Melwani's emphasis on building a single source-of-truth finance data pipeline and modern ETL usage, indicating strong strategic ops orientation. Independent, in-depth verification of scope and outcomes is limited.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - [FACT – medium] Census/Fivetran case study documents Figma CFO discussion about unified finance data pipelines.
  - [OBSERVATION] Public social posts reference data-driven finance and cross-functional FP&A work.

### Team Leadership (20)

- **Score:** 3
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** He has held progressive finance leadership roles at Figma (FP&A → CFO) which implies team leadership, but available public sources do not detail org size, direct reports, or specific talent-building outcomes—evidence is therefore mixed.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - [FACT – medium] Career timeline shows progression into senior finance leadership at Figma.
  - [OBSERVATION] No independent in-depth profiles found that describe leadership style or team scale.

### GTM Partnership (15)

- **Score:** 3
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Confidence:** Low
- **Reasoning:** Reporting and the Bloomberg episode highlight cross-functional collaboration in a product-centric freemium→enterprise motion, suggesting partnership with GTM, but there is limited direct evidence of measurable impact (quota, pipeline acceleration, revenue ops ownership).
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - [OBSERVATION] Bloomberg podcast discusses scaling freemium-to-enterprise and finance-product collaboration.
  - [FACT – low/medium] Social posts imply cross-functional work but lack concrete GTM KPIs.

### Systems Modernization (15)

- **Score:** 5
- **Evidence Level:** High
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** Vendor case study (Census/Fivetran) and public statements attribute a unified finance data pipeline / single-source-of-truth effort to the Figma finance organization while he was leading finance—this is strong evidence of hands-on systems modernization.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - [FACT – high] Census/Fivetran customer case study documents Figma CFO discussion on implementing a single source-of-truth finance pipeline.
  - [FACT – medium] LinkedIn and other posts reference modern ETL/data tooling in finance.

## Must-Haves Check
| Requirement | Met | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IPO preparation / experience leading through IPO | Yes | Role as CFO/Treasurer at Figma during the company's IPO is documented in public filings and coverage (SEC filings / Bloomberg). |
| SaaS ARR > $50M | No | Public research confirms Figma is a late-stage/public SaaS company, but no verified citation in the provided materials explicitly confirms ARR > $50M; this should be validated from S-1/10-K or investor materials. |

## Signal Inventory
### Green Flags
- Held CFO/Treasurer role at Figma through late-stage financing and IPO — direct capital markets exposure and public-company reporting experience (SEC / Bloomberg).
- Documented execution of finance systems modernization (single source-of-truth pipeline) via vendor case study (Census/Fivetran).
- Experience in product-centric, freemium→enterprise SaaS business — relevant GTM and commercial finance domain knowledge for enterprise SaaS.
- Public-facing posts and a Bloomberg feature indicate an emphasis on data-driven finance and cross-functional collaboration.

### Red Flags
- Limited independent press or in-depth interviews — few third-party profiles tying specific transactions or initiatives to Melwani (limits external validation of personal ownership).
- Early-career roles and education not verifiable in provided sources — gaps in background checks that matter for board-level hires.
- No clear public evidence of leading very large finance teams or defined talent-building outcomes (org size/scale unclear).
- Insider transaction reporting (investing.com mentioned) flags executive stock activity—requires context and diligence to rule out governance or timing concerns.

## Counterfactual Evidence Requests
- If he can provide org charts and examples showing he led a 50+ person finance organization through scaling and hiring, Team Leadership could move 3→4 (or 4→5 if proven across multiple stages).
- If he documents direct, attributable leadership on one or more major financing rounds (term sheets, negotiation leadership), Fundraising Excellence could move 4→5.
- If S-1 / 10-K or reliable public filings confirm Figma ARR > $50M at time of IPO or recently, the must-have ARR check would flip to met and increase overall partner confidence materially.
- If he can cite specific GTM-impact metrics (e.g., finance-driven pricing changes, sales efficiency improvements, quota attainment lift tied to finance initiatives), GTM Partnership could move 3→4.
