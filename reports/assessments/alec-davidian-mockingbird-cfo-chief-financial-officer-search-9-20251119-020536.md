# Assessment Report – Alec Davidian

- **Candidate:** Alec Davidian
- **Screen:** Mockingbird-CFO (Chief Financial Officer) Search-9
- **Assessment ID:** N/A

## Summary
- **Overall Score:** 70.0
- **Overall Confidence:** Medium

[Overall: Moderate‑Strong] Fit for a consumer DTC CFO where capital‑markets experience and public‑company rigor are priorities; weaker evidence on deep DTC unit‑economics ownership and org‑building. A FirstMark partner/board will value his public‑company, SEC and capital markets track record (de‑SPAC and follow‑on offering) and EY audit foundation. They should probe unit‑economics (CAC/LTV) ownership and examples of building finance teams — answers there could move the candidate from adequate→strong on the DTC and Operational/Leadership dimensions.

## Dimension Deep-Dive
### Fundraising & Investor Relations

- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence Level:** High
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** Public-company capital markets experience is well documented: Davidian led the finance function through Wag!'s de‑SPAC/public listing (2022) and supported a follow‑on underwritten equity offering (2024). He has public investor communications (Q4 2023 presentation) and signed SEC filings (8‑K, 10‑K). However, there is limited public evidence he personally originated multiple large VC rounds or $50M+ private rounds, so this is a strong capital‑markets / investor‑relations fit rather than exceptional VC fundraising leadership.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Led finance function through de‑SPAC to public listing (2022).
  - Supported follow‑on equity capital markets activity (2024 underwriting agreement).
  - Responsible for earnings communications (Q4 2023) and signed SEC filings (10‑K, 8‑K).

### DTC/E-commerce Finance Expertise

- **Score:** 3
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** Davidian's experience is clearly in consumer/pet‑services and marketplace finance (Wag! is a consumer marketplace / pet‑tech company). That supports an adequate DTC/consumer finance background. Public evidence does not, however, document direct ownership of CAC/LTV optimization, ecommerce unit-economics, subscription/retention metric ownership, or scaling to $100M+ revenue where he led DTC finance decisions.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Sector expertise: pet services / pet‑tech, consumer marketplace.
  - Wag! finance responsibilities include forecasting and public reporting for a consumer marketplace business.
- **Citations:**

### Operational Finance & Systems

- **Score:** 3
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Confidence:** Low
- **Reasoning:** Public filings and role descriptions show responsibility for financial reporting, forecasting and SEC compliance (typical FP&A responsibilities). However, there is no clear public evidence he implemented ERPs/NetSuite or built a modern finance tech stack from scratch, so operational finance capability appears solid but not demonstrably exceptional.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - CFO responsibilities include financial reporting, forecasting and SEC compliance.
  - Promoted from Corporate Controller to CFO — indicates operational finance responsibilities.

### Financial Leadership Scope

- **Score:** Pending
- **Evidence Level:** Low
- **Confidence:** Low
- **Reasoning:** Public materials do not disclose team size, direct reports, or clear hiring/organizational build‑out led by Davidian. Given this lack of primary evidence, a score would be speculative; mark as null until the candidate can provide verified details on org size and leadership scope.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - No public data found on team size, budget responsibility, or hire history.

### Growth Stage Exposure

- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence Level:** High
- **Confidence:** High
- **Reasoning:** Davidian has direct, documented experience taking Wag! through a de‑SPAC / reverse recapitalization to public listing (2022) and managing subsequent public company growth capital activity (2024). This is strong growth‑stage and public market exposure; evidence supports scaling through late‑startup to public, though not multiple distinct startups through Series B→IPO.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Led finance through de‑SPAC to public listing (2022).
  - Involved in follow‑on public offering / underwriting activity (2024).
- **Citations:**

## Must-Haves Check
| Requirement | Met | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5+ years finance leadership experience | Yes | Promoted to VP/Finance & Accounting (2019–2021) then CFO (c.2021–present); with Wag! tenure from 2018 to present documented in SEC filings. |
| Prior Series B+ company experience | Yes | Wag! progressed through de‑SPAC to become a NASDAQ‑listed public company (2022) — clear late‑stage / public company exposure. |
| DTC/consumer business model expertise | Yes | Wag! is a consumer marketplace / pet‑services business; Davidian has been CFO/finance lead at the company (consumer sector experience documented). |
| Fundraising track record ($10M+ rounds) | Yes | Public SEC filings and underwriting/pos documents show involvement in material capital markets transactions (de‑SPAC, follow‑on offering). Exact private VC round leadership not documented. |

## Signal Inventory
### Green Flags
- Documented public‑company CFO experience: signed 10‑K and 8‑K filings and led earnings communications (Q4 2023) — valuable for governance and investor relations (citations: 10‑K, 8‑K).
- Led finance through de‑SPAC / reverse recapitalization to a NASDAQ listing (2022) — direct experience with complex capital markets transactions (SEC filings).
- Prior Big Four audit/accounting background (EY senior manager 2012–2018) — indicates strong accounting and controls foundation (career timeline).
- Involved in follow‑on equity underwriting activity (2024) and insider Form 4 transactions — demonstrates active capital markets engagement and SEC reporting familiarity.

### Red Flags
- Limited public professional footprint: no verifiable LinkedIn or expanded first‑party bio found — makes reference checks and resume verification harder (source: research gaps).
- No public evidence of owning DTC unit metrics (CAC/LTV) or ecommerce scaling decisions — risk for a DTC CFO role expecting deep unit‑economics leadership (source: Known Gaps).
- Team‑building scope unclear: no disclosed team size or hiring history — potential risk around scaling finance org post‑Series B/D (source: Known Gaps / SEC filings lack org detail).
- Education and broader prior employer history are incompletely documented in public sources — increases diligence burden for board (source: Known Gaps).

## Counterfactual Evidence Requests
- If the candidate can document hands‑on ownership of CAC/LTV and channel profitability (with concrete examples and metrics), DTC/E‑commerce Finance scores could move from 3→4 or 4→5.
- If he led hiring and built a cross‑functional finance organization (10+ direct reports, FP&A, accounting, revenue ops) post‑CFO promotion, Financial Leadership would move from null→4 (or higher).
- If he originated or led private growth rounds (Series B/C) >$10M in a lead role (not only public follow‑on offerings), Fundraising score could move from 4→5.
- If he ran a finance transformation (ERP/NetSuite roll‑out, modern BI/FP&A stack) with documented outcomes, Operational Finance & Systems could move from 3→5.
