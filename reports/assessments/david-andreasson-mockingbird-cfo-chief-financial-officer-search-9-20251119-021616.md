# Assessment Report – David Andreasson

- **Candidate:** David Andreasson
- **Screen:** Mockingbird-CFO (Chief Financial Officer) Search-9
- **Assessment ID:** N/A

## Summary
- **Overall Score:** 44.0
- **Overall Confidence:** Medium

Overall: Marginal fit — candidate shows solid CEO-level operational experience but lacks verifiable DTC finance and fundraising credentials. Board/partners will care most about the candidate's verified identity, concrete fundraising and DTC experience; if Nitro CFO status and documented $10M+ raises or DTC finance work are confirmed, fundraising and stage-scaling scores could materially improve. The main upside is demonstrated leadership and transaction experience at Stockwik; the main downside is the sparse, partially conflicting public record that prevents confident assessment for a FirstMark DTC/CFO role.

## Dimension Deep-Dive
### Fundraising & Investor Relations

- **Score:** 2
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Confidence:** Low
- **Reasoning:** Public sources show M&A activity and directed share actions at Stockwik while Andreasson was CEO, but there is no clear public record that he led $10M+ rounds, major financing rounds, or high-profile investor relations. The Nitro CFO listing (The Org) is likely conflated with a different individual, reducing confidence that he has a distinct, documented fundraising track record.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Stockwik förvärvar Fysrehab Lidköping – Inderes (acquisition announced Dec 1, 2022)
  - Stockwik has resolved on a directed share issue… – GlobeNewswire (directed share issue mentioned)
  - David Andreasson - Chief Financial Officer at Nitro | The Org (Nitro org chart listing; identity may be conflated)

### DTC/E-commerce Finance Expertise

- **Score:** 1
- **Evidence Level:** Low
- **Confidence:** High
- **Reasoning:** No public evidence of DTC or e-commerce finance experience (CAC/LTV, channel economics, Shopify/marketplace experience). Candidate's background appears focused on SaaS/document productivity and industrial/services, not consumer/DTC.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Sector Expertise: Document productivity software / SaaS, Industrial / services (Stockwik - wood preservation/investments)
  - No public record of consumer/DTC roles or CAC/LTV commentary in available sources

### Operational Finance & Systems

- **Score:** 2
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Confidence:** Low
- **Reasoning:** There is limited public evidence of hands-on FP&A, ERP/NetSuite implementations, or finance systems transformations. As CEO of Stockwik Andreasson likely ran operations and oversaw transactions, but specific operational finance/system-build experience is not documented.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Co‑founded and led Stockwik (2013–2023); oversaw acquisitions (Fysrehab, Dec 1, 2022)
  - No public mention of building FP&A or implementing ERP/NetSuite

### Financial Leadership Scope

- **Score:** 3
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** Ten years as co‑founder/CEO of Stockwik indicates sustained leadership and likely people management across functions, which supports an 'adequate' leadership score. However, team sizes and explicit finance org-building responsibilities are not documented, preventing a higher score.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Chief Executive Officer (and co‑founder) at Stockwik Förvaltning AB (2013 - September 22, 2023)
  - Stockwik VD David Andreasson lämnar bolaget – Inderes (leadership tenure and departure)

### Growth Stage Exposure

- **Score:** 3
- **Evidence Level:** High
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** Evidence shows experience leading a company through M&A and capital actions (Stockwik) and an asserted CFO role at Nitro (growth-stage SaaS) though that Nitro claim is contested. He has exposure to growth and corporate actions but no documented Series B→IPO trajectory or repeat scaling at VC-backed consumer startups.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Stockwik förvärvar Fysrehab Lidköping – Inderes (M&A while CEO)
  - Nitro CFO listing on The Org (asserted SaaS growth-stage exposure) — identity potentially conflated

## Must-Haves Check
| Requirement | Met | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5+ years finance leadership experience | No | Andreasson has long CEO experience (2013–2023) and an asserted CFO listing at Nitro, but there is insufficient verified public evidence of 5+ years in dedicated finance leadership roles (CFO/Head of Finance). |
| Prior Series B+ company experience | No | No clear public record of Series B+ company roles; Nitro listing suggests growth-stage SaaS but the Nitro CFO identity appears conflated and Series financing details are not documented. |
| DTC/consumer business model expertise | No | Public sector experience appears to be SaaS and industrial/services (Stockwik); no evidence of DTC/e-commerce roles or CAC/LTV experience. |
| Fundraising track record ($10M+ rounds) | No | No public record of Andreasson leading $10M+ fundraises or named as lead on major financing rounds. |

## Signal Inventory
### Green Flags
- Long-term CEO experience: co‑founder and CEO of Stockwik (2013–2023) indicates sustained leadership and operational responsibility (Inderes release).
- M&A and corporate actions exposure: publicly reported acquisition (Fysrehab, Dec 1, 2022) and subsequent directed share actions demonstrate transaction experience at CEO level (Inderes; GlobeNewswire).
- Member of FirstMark Guilds CFO community — suggests engagement with CFO peer network (research notes).
- Listed in corporate directories (The Org) as Nitro CFO — if verified, would indicate SaaS growth-stage CFO experience and cross-border exposure (The Org listing).

### Red Flags
- Identity conflation risk: public sources (The Org) list a 'David Andreasson' as Nitro CFO but other evidence indicates the Swedish Stockwik CEO is a different person — creates material uncertainty about the candidate's CV (The Org; Inderes).
- No documented consumer/DTC experience — misalignment with role requirement for DTC finance expertise (sector research shows SaaS and industrial focus).
- No public record of leading significant fundraises ($10M+) or investor-facing transactions — weak evidence for fundraising & investor relations capability (no disclosed rounds or board citations).
- Sparse public footprint: no LinkedIn, CV, interviews, or deal-level disclosures — limits ability to validate claims and increases diligence burden.
- Operational finance specifics missing: no documentation of FP&A builds, ERP/NetSuite implementations, or finance systems leadership.

## Counterfactual Evidence Requests
- If the candidate can provide an official Nitro press release or employment record confirming CFO appointment and start date (with scope), Fundraising and Growth Stage scores could move from 2→4 and 3→4 respectively.
- If the candidate produces a verifiable list of rounds they led or were the primary investor-relations lead on (including amounts ≥ $10M), Fundraising & Investor Relations could move from 2→5.
- If the candidate documents 3+ years of direct DTC finance ownership (P&L for DTC brands, CAC/LTV optimization, platform experience like Shopify), DTC/E-commerce Finance Expertise could move from 1→4.
- If the candidate provides org charts and headcount details showing they built a finance function (hired FP&A, controller, systems), Operational Finance & Systems and Financial Leadership Scope could move from 2→4 and 3→4 respectively.
- If identity conflation is resolved showing these are two different people, and the Swedish Stockwik founder has limited finance leadership beyond CEO duties, many scores may be downgraded — so verifying identity is critical before progressing.
