# Assessment Report – Mohit Daswani

- **Candidate:** Mohit Daswani
- **Screen:** Mockingbird-CFO (Chief Financial Officer) Search-9
- **Assessment ID:** N/A

## Summary
- **Overall Score:** 72.0
- **Overall Confidence:** Medium

[Overall: Strong] Fit as a late-stage CFO with clear strengths in capital markets readiness, finance organization scaling, and fintech/SaaS operational finance. A FirstMark partner or board should lean on his IPO-prep and investor-relations experience and fintech payments background; expect upside in systematizing FP&A and working with investors. The primary downside is limited public evidence of hands-on DTC/e-commerce P&L experience (CAC/LTV, Shopify/marketplace-specific work), which is a core must-have for a DTC-focused role.

## Dimension Deep-Dive
### Fundraising & Investor Relations (25)

- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence Level:** High
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** Held CFO at ThoughtSpot (Jan 2020–Jul 2024) and publicly discussed prepping finance for an IPO (CFO Notebook 2022; ThoughtSpot blog). Board role at Centana (2018–present) adds governance and investor-facing experience. Multiple reliable sources but no public proof he personally led multiple $50M+ rounds or completed an IPO, so score is Strong (4).

### DTC/E-commerce Finance Expertise (25)

- **Score:** 2
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** Public career shows strong fintech, SaaS and health-tech experience (ThoughtSpot, Square, PayPal, SimplePractice) and board exposure to consumer portfolio companies via Centana, but no direct public evidence of hands-on DTC finance leadership (CAC/LTV management, Shopify/marketplace finance, or scaling a DTC P&L to $100M+). This is a weak fit against a DTC-first requirement.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Board Member at Centana Growth Partners since 2018 (consumer portfolio oversight) (research summary)
  - Career roles: ThoughtSpot (SaaS), Square (fintech), PayPal (payments), SimplePractice (health-tech) (research summary)

### Operational Finance & Systems (20)

- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** As ThoughtSpot's CFO he publicly described scaling the finance function and preparing for IPO (CFO Notebook, ThoughtSpot blog). Prior senior finance roles at Square and PayPal imply deep FP&A and operational finance experience. No explicit public citation of implementing specific ERP/Netsuite instances, so score is Strong (4) but not Exceptional.

### Financial Leadership Scope (15)

- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** Research describes him as ThoughtSpot's first CFO who scaled the finance organization and has prior senior leadership at Square and PayPal; board role at Centana supports governance experience. No public statements of team size (e.g., 20+ across functions), so leadership is strong but lacks explicit evidence to rate Exceptional (5).

### Growth Stage Exposure (15)

- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence Level:** High
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** CFO at ThoughtSpot during a late-stage/IPO-prep period (2020–2024), senior roles at Square and PayPal during rapid growth, and Centana board oversight of growth-stage consumer companies — indicates strong exposure to scaling through growth stages. Lacks public evidence of multiple completed IPOs or serial exits, so score is Strong (4).
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - ThoughtSpot CFO role and IPO preparation (CFO Notebook 2022; ThoughtSpot blog)
  - Senior finance roles at Square (2017–2019) and PayPal (approx. 2014–2016)

## Must-Haves Check
| Requirement | Met | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5+ years finance leadership experience | Yes | Long-tenured senior finance roles: CFO ThoughtSpot (2020–2024), Head of Finance & Strategy at Square (2017–2019), CFO roles at PayPal; research confidence Medium. |
| Prior Series B+ company experience | Yes | ThoughtSpot and Square were late-stage, venture-backed/high-growth companies; ThoughtSpot specifically was preparing for IPO while he was CFO. |
| DTC/consumer business model expertise | No | No public evidence of hands-on DTC finance leadership or managing CAC/LTV for a DTC P&L; board exposure to Centana's consumer portfolio is present but insufficient. |
| Fundraising track record ($10M+ rounds) | Yes | Public-facing role as ThoughtSpot CFO during late-stage rounds and IPO preparation implies material involvement with large fundraising and investor relations; however, no explicit citation of personally leading specific $10M+ rounds. |

## Signal Inventory
### Green Flags
- Strong late-stage finance leadership and capital markets experience as ThoughtSpot's CFO with public commentary on IPO preparation (CFO Notebook; ThoughtSpot blog).
- Senior fintech pedigree at Square and PayPal, suggesting deep payments and SaaS monetization finance knowledge (research summary).
- Board governance experience at Centana Growth Partners since 2018 — useful for investor relations and consumer-go-to-market oversight.
- Demonstrated ability to scale finance organizations (described as scaling finance and being first CFO at ThoughtSpot).

### Red Flags
- Limited direct DTC/e-commerce operational evidence — no public proof of managing CAC/LTV or scaling a DTC P&L (research summary).
- Unclear current role timeline — LinkedIn shows SimplePractice CFO (Nov 2024) and ThoughtSpot advisor transition mid-2024; gap in public confirmation of responsibilities post-2024.
- No publicly cited examples of implementing specific finance systems (NetSuite/ERP) or modern tech stack deployments at scale — potential unknown in systems-driven transformations.
- No public record of leading multiple IPOs or $50M+ rounds personally; role appears to be IPO-prep rather than completed IPO experience.

## Counterfactual Evidence Requests
- If the candidate has run finance for a consumer-facing business (P&L ownership with CAC/LTV metrics) for 3+ years, DTC/E-commerce score could move from 2 → 4 (ask for specific P&L, channel-specific LTV/CAC examples and results).
- If he led a completed IPO or was the named finance leader on a completed exit, Fundraising & Investor Relations could move 4 → 5 (ask for exact rounds he led, SEC filings or press naming him as lead finance owner).
- If he implemented a modern finance tech stack (NetSuite/ERP, analytics platform, full FP&A rebuild) and can cite vendor names and team size, Operational Finance & Systems could move 4 → 5 (request project summaries and timelines).
- If he can document building and managing a finance organization of 20+ people across functions, Financial Leadership Scope could move 4 → 5 (ask for org chart, hires credited to him, and cross-functional leadership examples).
