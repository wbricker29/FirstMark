# Assessment Report – Deb Schwartz

- **Candidate:** Deb Schwartz
- **Screen:** Pigment-CFO (Chief Financial Officer) Search-8
- **Assessment ID:** N/A

## Summary
- **Overall Score:** 72.0
- **Overall Confidence:** Medium

[Overall: Medium–Strong] CFO fit with strengths in capital-events and scaling finance for high-growth consumer and fintech businesses; strongest on strategic finance and people leadership, with gaps around verified SaaS >$50M ARR and concrete systems modernization evidence. FirstMark partners will care most about her direct ownership of fundraising rounds and demonstrable SaaS scale (ARR/headcount/FP&A systems). If she can verify leadership of >$50M ARR P&L or concrete platform modernization (ERP/FP&A/RevOps) and provide clear dates/references, Fundraising and Systems/Scaling scores could move meaningfully higher.

## Dimension Deep-Dive
### Fundraising Excellence (25)

- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** Research indicates direct involvement in Cameo Series C/D fundraising and investor relations work and a history of supporting capital events at Galileo (SoFi acquisition). Evidence is from secondary sources in the brief and lacks authoritative primary citations for exact round sizes and her title-involvement, so weight is medium.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Contributed to fundraising and IR strategy for Cameo's Series C/D activity (reported >$70M involvement—needs verification).
  - Prepared Galileo for exit and supported acquisition-related financial processes (SoFi acquisition, 2020).

### Strategic Finance Ops (25)

- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** Candidate is described as a strategic, KPI-driven CFO who built KPI frameworks, stronger controls and prepared finance for rapid growth and exit processes. These claims are consistent across the research but rely on summarized secondary descriptions; primary supporting documents (e.g., Cameo press releases, Galileo filings) are not provided.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Spearheaded Cameo's financial strategy and KPI frameworks during explosive growth.
  - Built and scaled finance function at Cameo, including senior hires and stronger financial controls.

### Team Leadership (20)

- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** Research explicitly states she built the finance function at Cameo and made senior hires, showing people leadership and org-building. However, org size, span of control, and concrete metrics (headcount grown, senior direct reports) are not documented, limiting confidence.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Built and scaled finance function at Cameo, including senior hires and stronger financial controls.

### GTM Partnership (15)

- **Score:** 3
- **Evidence Level:** Low
- **Confidence:** Low
- **Reasoning:** There are mentions of cross-functional alignment (notably with People/HR) and KPI-driven decision-making, but direct evidence of partnership with Sales/Marketing/Rev Ops or influence over pricing, go-to-market strategy, or revenue ops is thin in the provided research.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Characterized as a strategic, data-driven CFO who emphasizes KPI-driven decision-making, cross-functional alignment (notably with People/HR).

### Systems Modernization (15)

- **Score:** 3
- **Evidence Level:** Low
- **Confidence:** Low
- **Reasoning:** The research references stronger financial controls and scaling the finance function, implying some systems/process work. However, there is no concrete evidence of platforms implemented (ERP, FP&A tooling, RevOps stack) or a documented modernization program, so score is conservative.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Built and scaled finance function at Cameo, including senior hires and stronger financial controls.

## Must-Haves Check
| Requirement | Met | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IPO preparation experience | Yes | Research identifies IPO-readiness work and experience preparing Galileo for exit and supporting acquisition-related processes (SoFi acquisition). Multiple mentions of pre-IPO readiness and exit support suggest relevant experience, though primary documents are not provided. |
| Experience at a SaaS company with ARR > $50M | No | No primary evidence provided that Deb led finance at a SaaS company with >$50M ARR. Cameo is a consumer/creator marketplace with reported growth, and Galileo is fintech/BaaS; neither in the research includes verified ARR figures >$50M attributable to her role. |

## Signal Inventory
### Green Flags
- Exit and M&A experience: documented involvement in preparing Galileo for exit and in SoFi acquisition-related finance work — demonstrates transactional and acquirer-facing experience.
- Scale-stage CFO experience: described as leading finance through rapid growth at Cameo and building senior finance hires — useful for Series B+/pre-IPO companies.
- KPI-driven, cross-functional orientation: repeatedly noted emphasis on KPIs and alignment across functions (People/HR), indicating strategic partnership skills.
- Investor relations and fundraising exposure: credited with contributing to Series C/D fundraising and IR strategy at Cameo, suggesting board/investor comfort.
- Sector fit across fintech and creator/marketplace: experience in fintech (Galileo) and consumer marketplaces (Cameo) maps to companies in adjacent portfolio categories.

### Red Flags
- Employment record gaps and status ambiguity: authoritative LinkedIn/profile URL and exact start/end dates for Cameo/Galileo are missing — complicates reference checking and recency verification.
- Fundraising amounts and direct ownership unclear: the reported “>$70M involvement" in Cameo rounds is unverified in primary sources; can't confirm scale or leadership role in rounds.
- SaaS ARR requirement unproven: no reliable evidence that she led finance at a SaaS business with >$50M ARR — material must-have unfulfilled.
- Systems/program specifics missing: limited public detail on platforms, ERP/FP&A tooling or RevOps partnerships; hard to judge modernization depth.
- Possible status confusion in press: some secondary sources ambiguously label her 'former' vs 'current' CFO — needs confirmation to assess recency of experience.

## Counterfactual Evidence Requests
- If she led or owned a finance organization at a SaaS company with >$50M ARR (provide company name, year(s), and audited/board-reported ARR) — Fundraising and Strategic Finance Ops could move 4→5 and 3→4 respectively.
- If she can provide exact role-based details on Cameo Series C/D (lead negotiator, board-facing IR owner, and dollar amounts under her management) — Fundraising score could move 4→5.
- If she can document the finance tech stack and a systems modernization program (ERP migration, FP&A tooling, automated reporting, RevOps integration) with outcomes (reduced close time, forecasting accuracy) — Systems Modernization could move 3→4.
- If she provides org charts and headcount growth showing she scaled to a 10+ person finance organization with senior direct reports (controller/treasury/FP&A) — Team Leadership could move 4→5.
- If she confirms current employment status with start/end dates and provides 2–3 references (board investor, former CEO, head of HR) who can vouch for IPO-readiness work, overall confidence would move from Medium→High.
