# Assessment Report – Brittany Bagley

- **Candidate:** Brittany Bagley
- **Screen:** Mockingbird-CFO (Chief Financial Officer) Search-9
- **Assessment ID:** N/A

## Summary
- **Overall Score:** 70.0
- **Overall Confidence:** Medium

[Overall: Moderate Strength] Public-company CFO with private-equity depth; strong on governance and capital-markets exposure, but limited public evidence on hands‑on DTC e‑commerce metrics and documented fundraising transactions. A FirstMark partner will value her public-company CFO/PE background and board experience for investor relations and transaction fluency. The biggest surprises will be on the upside if she can demonstrate direct ownership of DTC unit-economics (CAC/LTV) and operational finance system builds; on the downside, lack of documented fundraising leadership or systems implementations could limit fit for a scaling DTC e-commerce company.

## Dimension Deep-Dive
### Fundraising & Investor Relations

- **Score:** 3
- **Evidence Level:** High
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** Public-company CFO roles at Sonos (2019–2022) and Axon (from Sep 2022) demonstrate investor relations and capital-markets exposure (Sonos 8-K; Axon press release). However, there is no public evidence that she led large private rounds ($20M+) or an IPO, nor are documented financings or capital raises led by her cited. Given confirmed public-company IR experience but absence of documented large rounds, score is 3.

### DTC/E-commerce Finance Expertise

- **Score:** 3
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Confidence:** Low
- **Reasoning:** Sector exposure to consumer electronics (Sonos) is documented, which implies some familiarity with consumer go-to-market models (Sonos press release). However, there is no direct public evidence she managed DTC unit economics (CAC/LTV), ran e-commerce operations, or owned subscription/retention metrics. Evidence is therefore mixed/inferential rather than direct.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Sonos is a consumer electronics company; Bagley served as Sonos CFO (press release/8-K)

### Operational Finance & Systems

- **Score:** Pending
- **Evidence Level:** Low
- **Confidence:** Low
- **Reasoning:** No public documentation was found describing specific FP&A build-outs, ERP/NetSuite implementations, finance transformation programs, or systems ownership led by Bagley. While CFO titles imply operational finance responsibility, the research contains no confirmatory primary evidence; therefore this dimension is left null rather than guessed.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - _No quotes captured._

  - _No citations provided._

### Financial Leadership Scope

- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence Level:** High
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** Confirmed CFO roles at two public companies (Sonos; Axon) and prior board director role at Sonos indicate meaningful leadership and cross-functional seniority (Sonos press release; Axon PR). Specific team sizes and org-build metrics are not public, so score is strong but not highest.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Sonos CFO role and prior Sonos board director status
  - Axon announcement naming Bagley CFO & CBO
- **Citations:**

### Growth Stage Exposure

- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence Level:** High
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** Her background includes long tenure at KKR in TMT private equity (approx. 12 years) and CFO roles at public companies (Sonos, Axon), giving exposure across private-equity-backed and public-company growth stages. There is no public evidence she personally led startups from Series A→IPO multiple times, so score is strong but not exceptional.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - KKR tenure (TMT PE) ~2007–2019 (research summary)
  - Sonos and Axon CFO roles (press releases, 8-K)
- **Citations:**

## Must-Haves Check
| Requirement | Met | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5+ years finance leadership experience | Yes | CFO of Sonos (2019–2022) and CFO & CBO of Axon (from Sep 26, 2022) — documented in company announcements and SEC filing. |
| Prior Series B+ company experience | Yes | Roles at public companies (Sonos, Axon) and long private-equity tenure imply Series B+ exposure. |
| DTC/consumer business model expertise | Yes | Worked as CFO of Sonos (consumer electronics) — indicates consumer sector experience though direct DTC metric ownership is unproven. |
| Fundraising track record ($10M+ rounds) | No | No public evidence found that Bagley led $10M+ private fundraising rounds or similar transactions; fundraising leadership is unproven in available sources. |

## Signal Inventory
### Green Flags
- Two confirmed public-company CFO roles (Sonos; Axon) — clear capital-markets and public-company finance experience (Sonos 8-K; Axon PR)
- Long private-equity background at KKR in TMT (approx. 12 years) — strong transaction, diligence and deal experience
- Served as a Sonos board director before becoming CFO — governance and board-level experience
- Transition from Sonos CFO to Axon CFO & CBO shows readiness for expanded remit and cross-functional responsibility (Axon press release)

### Red Flags
- No verifiable public leadership bio or LinkedIn found — transparency/verification risk (research notes 'No verifiable public profile')
- No documented instances of leading large fundraising rounds or private financings — raises question about hands-on fundraising track record for growth-stage checks
- No public evidence of operational finance/system implementations (ERP, NetSuite, FP&A rebuild) — risk for companies needing finance systems scaling
- Lack of publicly cited, quantifiable achievements (revenue growth, cost/cash metrics, M&A led) — makes impact assessment difficult for a board

## Counterfactual Evidence Requests
- Ask for concrete fundraising deals she led (size, role, instrument). If she led multiple $20M+ raises or a significant equity/debt issuance as CFO, Fundraising score could move 3→5.
- Request detailed examples of DTC/e-commerce KPIs she owned (CAC, LTV, cohort retention) and outcomes. If she ran CAC/LTV optimization and grew DTC revenue to $100M+, DTC score could move 3→5.
- Ask for a breakdown of the finance org she built/managed (team size, functions, systems implemented). If she built an FP&A + accounting org and implemented modern ERP/BI (NetSuite, adaptive, etc.), Operational Finance could move null→4 or 5.
- Probe for direct involvement in scaling companies from early growth to exit (Series A→IPO) with quantifiable metrics. If she has multiple such experiences, Growth Stage Exposure could move 4→5.
