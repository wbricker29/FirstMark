# Assessment Report – Madalina Tanasie

- **Candidate:** Madalina Tanasie
- **Screen:** Pigment-CFO (Chief Financial Officer) Search-8
- **Assessment ID:** N/A

## Summary
- **Overall Score:** 80.0
- **Overall Confidence:** Low

[Overall: Mixed] Strong engineering and platform CTO with clear internal credibility at Collibra; major gaps on fundraising and finance operations required by the role. A FirstMark partner/board will value her deep platform and enterprise-data SaaS experience and internal promotion to CTO, but should expect downside risk around capital-markets leadership, IPO readiness, and measurable revenue/finance ownership unless those capabilities are proven in follow-up conversations or references.

## Dimension Deep-Dive
### Fundraising Excellence (25)

- **Score:** Pending
- **Evidence Level:** Low
- **Confidence:** Low
- **Reasoning:** No public evidence (press releases, bios, or media) documents direct responsibility for fundraising, leading financing rounds, or managing investor relationships. Collibra press release and bios describe technical/engineering leadership but do not reference fundraising or capital markets experience (Collibra press release; Clay dossier).
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Collibra press release announcing Madalina Tanasie as CTO emphasizes engineering/product contributions but does not mention fundraising responsibilities.
  - Third-party bios (Clay/TheOrg) list CTO/advisory roles without fundraising detail.

### Strategic Finance Ops (25)

- **Score:** Pending
- **Evidence Level:** Low
- **Confidence:** Low
- **Reasoning:** No verifiable public evidence that she has owned finance operations (forecasting, FP&A, working capital, budgeting at the company level) or led finance transformations. Collibra materials and available bios describe engineering/product leadership, not finance ownership or IPO/close-work with CFO functions.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Collibra press release—focus on engineering/product leadership; no finance/FP&A claims.
  - Available third-party bios summarize technical career, not strategic finance roles.

### Team Leadership (20)

- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** Strong signal of internal promotion into a C-suite technology role (Collibra press release) and a multi-year senior engineering/platform career (Medidata roles) indicate proven leadership of engineering and platform teams. However, public sources lack quantified scope (team size, direct reports, P&L/budget ownership), which limits scoring from 5→4.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - "Collibra Appoints Madalina Tanasie as Chief Technology Officer" — company press release highlighting her internal rise and contributions.
  - Career timeline shows senior platform and engineering leadership at Medidata (Sr. Director, VP Engineering) consistent with leading sizable teams.

  - https://www.clay.com/dossier/collibra-cto

### GTM Partnership (15)

- **Score:** Pending
- **Evidence Level:** Low
- **Confidence:** Low
- **Reasoning:** No public evidence documents regular cross-functional GTM partnership (e.g., close collaboration with sales/marketing to shape product-market fit, customer engagements tied to revenue outcomes). Collibra press materials emphasize product/engineering accomplishments but do not cite GTM co-ownership or measurable GTM impact.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Collibra press release and third-party bios emphasize engineering/product leadership but omit GTM partnership details.
  - No public interviews, case studies, or articles found that describe GTM joint work or revenue-facing responsibilities.
- **Citations:**

  - https://www.clay.com/dossier/collibra-cto

### Systems Modernization (15)

- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** Prior roles — VP Engineering, Unified Platform and Sr. Director, Platform Services at Medidata, plus CTO at Collibra — are consistent with owning platform/modernization efforts. Collibra press release and Medidata platform titles imply relevant experience modernizing enterprise data platforms, but public documentation lacks project-level metrics (cost reductions, migration scale, timelines), so score is 4.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Medidata roles: 'VP, Operations & Excellence', 'VP Engineering, Unified Platform', and 'Sr. Director, Platform Services' indicate platform modernization scope.
  - Collibra CTO press release emphasizes engineering and product development leadership at a data governance company implying platform/infra modernization accountability.

## Must-Haves Check
| Requirement | Met | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IPO preparation experience | No | No public evidence of IPO preparation, SEC filings involvement, or leading pre-IPO readiness at Collibra or prior employers. |
| Experience at SaaS companies with ARR > $50M | No | Collibra is a late-stage/private enterprise data SaaS company, but no public source provided verifies Madalina's direct P&L responsibility for a business with ARR >$50M or her ownership of revenue metrics. No ARR figures tied to her remit were found. |

## Signal Inventory
### Green Flags
- Internal promotion to CTO at Collibra — strong signal of peer/trust and performance inside a late-stage enterprise SaaS company (Collibra press release).
- Deep platform and engineering background (Medidata platform roles) consistent with leading systems modernization and large-scale engineering efforts.
- Sector expertise in data governance and enterprise SaaS aligns well with data-platform portfolio companies and B2B go-to-market patterns.
- Advisory board involvement (Bain Capital Ventures advisory board membership listed in org charts) suggests external recognition and network credibility.

### Red Flags
- No demonstrable fundraising or capital-markets experience — crucial for an executive expected to lead financing or IPO preparation (no sourcing in press release or bios).
- No public evidence of ownership of strategic finance operations (FP&A, budgeting, investor reporting), increasing risk for roles requiring cross-functional finance leadership.
- Limited public visibility on quantifiable leadership scope (team size, direct reports, budget/P&L), making it hard for a board to judge scale experience.
- GTM partnership and revenue-facing experience not documented — potential gap for product/tech leaders expected to align tightly with sales/marketing on revenue outcomes.
- Key CV items and verification gaps (exact CTO start date, education, links to referenced interviews/features) reduce referenceability during diligence.

## Counterfactual Evidence Requests
- Ask: "Have you led or been the executive sponsor for a fundraising round (Series C+) or managed investor relationships and due diligence?" — If yes with verifiable outcomes, Fundraising Excellence could move from null → 4.
- Ask: "Have you owned or co-owned corporate budgeting/FP&A, forecasting, or reporting to the CFO/board? Provide examples and metrics." — If yes, Strategic Finance Ops could move from null → 4.
- Ask: "What is the largest engineering organization (headcount, direct reports) you've managed and what budgets/P&L were under your remit?" — If they led 200+ engineers and had budget/P&L ownership, Team Leadership could move 4 → 5.
- Ask: "Give examples of specific GTM collaborations where your tech/product work directly increased bookings or ARR (metrics preferred)." — If provided, GTM Partnership could move from null → 4.
- Ask: "Describe a major modernization/migration you led (scope, timeline, impact on availability/cost), with measurable results." — If they provide metrics (cost reduction, latency, migration of X customers), Systems Modernization could move 4 → 5.
