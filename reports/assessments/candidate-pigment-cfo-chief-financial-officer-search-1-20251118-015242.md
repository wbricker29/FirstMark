# Assessment Report – Unknown Candidate

- **Candidate:** Unknown Candidate
- **Screen:** Pigment-CFO (Chief Financial Officer) Search-1
- **Assessment ID:** N/A

## Summary
- **Overall Score:** Pending
- **Overall Confidence:** High

[Overall: Unverifiable] Candidate lacks publicly verifiable experience necessary to assess fit for a FirstMark portfolio CFO role; critical must-haves (IPO prep and SaaS >$50M ARR) are unproven. A partner or board will care most about the inability to corroborate identity, company, and outcomes quickly — this is a deal-breaker for board-level financial hires unless resolved. The upside would be material if the candidate can produce confidential evidence (company name, filings, and specific fundraising/ARR metrics); the downside is that additional diligence may reveal no matching experience.

## Dimension Deep-Dive
### Fundraising Excellence (25)

- **Score:** Pending
- **Evidence Level:** High
- **Confidence:** High
- **Reasoning:** No verifiable public evidence of fundraising activity, capital raises, lead investor relationships, or participation in an IPO or significant financing rounds. Research explicitly states searches of funding databases, press, and filings returned no verifiable background or achievements. Because the role requires demonstrable fundraising track record and none is publicly documented, the correct score is null (insufficient evidence) rather than a speculative low score.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Two targeted web searches did not surface any verifiable public records tying an Alex Rivera to a CFO role with IPO prep or SaaS ARR >$50M.
  - Searches of LinkedIn, company websites, major news outlets, funding/databases (Crunchbase, PitchBook), SEC/company filings, press releases... returned no verifiable background.

### Strategic Finance Ops (25)

- **Score:** Pending
- **Evidence Level:** High
- **Confidence:** High
- **Reasoning:** No documented examples of building FP&A, forecasting, capital allocation, corporate treasury, or strategic finance programs. No SEC or company filings, KPI improvements, or cited process/system leadership tied to Alex Rivera were found. Given the absence of verifiable operational track record, score is null (insufficient evidence).
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - No verifiable prior roles, employers, or career timeline entries beyond current title.
  - No public achievements (fundraising, M&A, KPI improvements) attributable to Alex Rivera.

### Team Leadership (20)

- **Score:** Pending
- **Evidence Level:** High
- **Confidence:** High
- **Reasoning:** There is no public evidence of org size led, direct reports, hiring/compensation programs, or leadership outcomes. The candidate is listed as a CFO on a team page with no bio or tenure, and otherwise there are no verifiable prior roles to infer leadership scale. Thus the dimension is unscorable (null) due to lack of evidence rather than negative proof.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - The only CFO-labeled hit was a small consultancy’s team page listing “Alex Rivera — Chief Financial Officer,” but it includes no bio, dates, or links to confirm identity; treat strictly as a lead, not a match.
  - No start date / tenure for current CFO role available.

### GTM Partnership (15)

- **Score:** Pending
- **Evidence Level:** High
- **Confidence:** High
- **Reasoning:** No evidence of collaboration with go-to-market teams (pricing, sales comp, ARR growth programs, revenue recognition policies) or examples of CFO-led GTM initiatives. Searches returned no public content establishing GTM partnership experience, so score is null for insufficient evidence.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - No verifiable background, prior roles, dates, education, or achievements.
  - No public profiles or filings that uniquely identify this Alex Rivera.

### Systems Modernization (15)

- **Score:** Pending
- **Evidence Level:** High
- **Confidence:** High
- **Reasoning:** No documented projects or statements about implementing ERP, FP&A tooling, data warehouses, or finance automation led by the candidate. Absent verifiable examples of systems modernization, the appropriate score is null (insufficient evidence).
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - No press releases, news articles, interviews, or conference appearances found.
  - No public social media or thought leadership content located.

## Must-Haves Check
| Requirement | Met | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IPO preparation experience | No | No evidence found of IPO preparation or related filings; searches of news, SEC filings and industry coverage returned no verifiable history. |
| Led/owned finance at a SaaS company with ARR > $50M | No | No verifiable company, ARR figures, or SaaS leadership roles found in public databases, filings, or professional profiles. |

## Signal Inventory
### Green Flags
- Listed as 'Chief Financial Officer' on a consultancy team page (Simmons Advantage) — a verifiable listing to start direct outreach (citation: https://www.simmonsadvantage.com/team).
- Extensive negative search results can be informative: the absence of contradictory public records reduces evidence of public negative events (citation: research summary).

### Red Flags
- Unable to verify identity or track record through standard public sources — hiring risk for a board (citation: research summary).
- No evidence of fundraising, IPO, or large-scale SaaS finance leadership — critical must-haves unproven (citation: research summary).
- High name-collision risk; 'Alex Rivera' is a common name and available records do not include disambiguating details (citation: research summary).
- Potential representation risk: listing on a team page without bio/links may indicate incomplete or unverifiable public claims (citation: Simmons Advantage team page).
- Lack of public references, filings, or measurable outcomes increases diligence burden and slows any onboarding/credentialing process (citation: research summary).

## Counterfactual Evidence Requests
- Ask for the current employer's legal name, recent 10-K/10-Q or investor presentation, and the candidate's role on any fundraising or IPO process. If they led an IPO or were CFO at a public company, Fundraising Excellence and Strategic Finance Ops could move from null → 5.
- Request a detailed org chart and list of direct reports for the finance function, plus headcount growth numbers. If they led a 50+ person finance/org team or scaled finance through Series C–IPO, Team Leadership could move from null → 4 or 5.
- Provide ARR-verified metrics or auditor/board minutes showing SaaS ARR > $50M. If provided, GTM Partnership and Strategic Finance Ops could move from null → 4.
- Ask for references from the CEO, Board Chair, and Head of Sales who can attest to GTM collaboration and systems projects. Positive references could move GTM Partnership and Systems Modernization from null → 4.
- Request evidence of systems implementations (vendor contracts, project summaries) and change-management outcomes. If they led an ERP/FP&A modernization at scale, Systems Modernization could move from null → 4.
