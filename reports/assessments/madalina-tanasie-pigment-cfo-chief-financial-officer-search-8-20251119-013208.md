# Assessment Report – Madalina Tanasie

- **Candidate:** Madalina Tanasie
- **Screen:** Pigment-CFO (Chief Financial Officer) Search-8
- **Assessment ID:** N/A

## Summary
- **Overall Score:** 56.0
- **Overall Confidence:** Medium

[Overall: Mixed] Technical leadership fit for a data/SaaS CTO seat; fundraising and IPO-readiness unproven. Madalina Tanasie is clearly a senior technical leader (CTO at Collibra, public thought leadership) and demonstrates a product-engineering hybrid profile that board and partners will value for systems, platform and product strategy. However, she lacks documented experience leading capital raises, investor relations, or formal IPO preparation and there is limited independent evidence of measurable business outcomes (ARR, headcount, revenue growth) under her leadership — these gaps are the primary areas of concern for a FirstMark partner hiring into a role requiring fundraising and IPO readiness.

## Dimension Deep-Dive
### Fundraising Excellence (25)

- **Score:** 1
- **Evidence Level:** Low
- **Confidence:** Low
- **Reasoning:** No public evidence that Madalina Tanasie has led or materially participated in corporate fundraising, investor relations, or capital markets processes; available sources are company announcements and thought pieces that describe technical leadership but do not document fundraising roles or outcomes.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Primary verifiable fact: Madalina Tanasie is Collibra's Chief Technology Officer (announced late 2021).
  - Known Gaps: Missing verified prior employers and detailed career history before Collibra; No public LinkedIn profile or CV located to confirm timeline and education.

### Strategic Finance Ops (25)

- **Score:** 2
- **Evidence Level:** Low
- **Confidence:** Low
- **Reasoning:** As CTO she likely influences cost, platform economics, and product direction, but there is no independent evidence she has owned strategic finance functions (forecasting, budgeting at company-wide level, FP&A leadership) or led finance transformations tied to ARR/metrics.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Official Collibra materials and company interviews characterize her as a technical-leadership hybrid: strong engineering depth and product-oriented leadership.
  - Known Gaps: No independent metrics on impact (product launches, revenue, team size, org changes) attributable to her tenure.

### Team Leadership (20)

- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** Company press materials and interviews describe her as a technical and product-oriented leader and the CEO publicly praised her leadership; she holds the CTO role at a growth-stage enterprise SaaS company, which implies senior people leadership responsibilities. However, there is no independent documentation of org size, direct reports, or measurable team outcomes.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Collibra Appoints Madalina Tanasie as Chief Technology Officer (announced late 2021).
  - Praised by Collibra CEO for leadership and engineering capability; Recognized for bridging engineering and product direction.

### GTM Partnership (15)

- **Score:** 3
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** Public materials emphasize her role as a bridge between engineering and product, which suggests collaboration with GTM functions; however, there is no direct evidence of partnership with sales/marketing on go-to-market strategy, pricing, or customer expansion programs.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Official Collibra materials and company interviews characterize her as a technical-leadership hybrid: strong engineering depth and product-oriented leadership.
  - Sector Expertise: Enterprise data governance & metadata management, Cloud / SaaS platforms, Big data / data management.

### Systems Modernization (15)

- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** As CTO at an enterprise SaaS/data governance vendor, public profiles and thought leadership pieces indicate technical leadership and platform focus; this supports capability to drive systems modernization. There is limited independent, specific evidence (e.g., projects, migrations, platform KPIs) to rate a top score.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Primary verifiable fact: Madalina Tanasie is Collibra's Chief Technology Officer (announced late 2021).
  - Published thought leadership (DevOps.com and company channels).

## Must-Haves Check
| Requirement | Met | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IPO preparation experience | No | No evidence found that Madalina Tanasie has led IPO preparation or served in a finance/operational role responsible for IPO readiness. Research lacks any IPO-related citations. |
| SaaS ARR > $50M (operating at or above this scale) | No | No verifiable public evidence in the provided research that confirms Collibra's ARR or that Madalina directly managed an organization operating at >$50M ARR. Collibra is a growth-stage enterprise SaaS company, but ARR figure is not documented in the supplied materials. |

## Signal Inventory
### Green Flags
- Current CTO at Collibra (announced late 2021) — strong indicator of senior technical leadership in enterprise data governance (support: Collibra press release).
- Described as a technical-product hybrid and public thought leader (DevOps.com, Collibra blog) — useful for technical credibility and cross-functional influence.
- Praised by Collibra CEO for leadership and engineering capability — positive internal endorsement (support: company announcement/quotes).
- Sector expertise in enterprise data governance and SaaS platforms — aligns with product domain knowledge likely relevant to FirstMark portfolio companies in data/SaaS.
- Published articles and visible external commentary — suggests the candidate is active in public technical discourse, useful for hiring signal and reputation.

### Red Flags
- No documented fundraising or investor-relations leadership — candidate would be untested on board/investor-facing capital markets work (support: absence of fundraising evidence in public materials).
- Missing verifiable previous career history and public professional profile (LinkedIn/CV not located) — increases risk on resume verification and reference checks (support: Known Gaps bullet).
- No measurable business outcomes tied to tenure (no ARR, revenue growth, headcount or product KPIs publicly attributed to her) — limits ability to validate impact (support: Known Gaps).
- Limited independent press coverage beyond company-sourced materials (most evidence is Collibra press/blog and authored pieces) — poses risk on external validation of claims.
- No evidence of IPO preparation or leading finance/FP&A transformations — critical must-have for the role spec is unproven.

## Counterfactual Evidence Requests
- If she led or co-led an institutional fundraising round (Series C+) or acted as the primary investor-facing technical executive, Fundraising Excellence could move from 1→4; ask for specific rounds, investor references, and materials showing her role in investor diligence.
- If she owned company-wide finance/ops initiatives (budgeting, forecasting, FP&A integrations) or ran finance-adjacent programs, Strategic Finance Ops could move from 2→4; ask for examples and outcomes (cost savings, forecast accuracy improvements, go-to-market unit economics influenced by tech decisions).
- If she can provide verifiable metrics (ARR influenced, product revenue uplift, headcount growth, retention improvements) tied to her tenure at Collibra, Team Leadership could move from 4→5 and Systems Modernization could move 4→5.
- If she can cite concrete GTM collaborations (joint programs with Sales/Marketing, pricing/product packaging changes she led), GTM Partnership could move from 3→4; request specific cross-functional case studies and customer references.
- If she has led an IPO readiness program or been part of an executive team through an IPO, the must-have IPO prep status would change to met — request detailed role description, timelines, and references from CFO/CEO or board members.
