# Assessment Report – Madalina Tanasie

- **Candidate:** Madalina Tanasie
- **Screen:** Pigment-CFO (Chief Financial Officer) Search-8
- **Assessment ID:** N/A

## Summary
- **Overall Score:** 60.0
- **Overall Confidence:** Medium

[Overall: Mixed/Moderate] CTO fit with strong engineering and systems-modernization chops but limited public evidence on fundraising, finance ownership, and GTM partnership. A FirstMark partner/board will likely find Madalina strongest on running technical transformations and modernizing engineering practices; they will be most concerned about lack of visible fundraising/IPO experience and direct revenue/GTM ownership. She could surprise on the upside if internal, non-public contributions to financial readiness or cross-functional revenue programs exist and can be documented.

## Dimension Deep-Dive
### Fundraising Excellence

- **Score:** 2
- **Evidence Level:** Low
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** No public evidence that Madalina has led or materially participated in fundraising rounds or investor relations; Collibra press materials and bios highlight technical and operational leadership but do not document fundraising or capital markets experience. This is a gap vs. a CFO/COO hire expectation for fundraising leadership.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Public sources confirm technical domain expertise and operational excellence but do not mention fundraising experience.
  - Fundraising experience not documented publicly (Known Gaps).

### Strategic Finance Ops

- **Score:** 3
- **Evidence Level:** Medium
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** As VP of Operations & Excellence and later CTO she led organizational and process transformation, which suggests strength in operationalizing processes that can support scalable finance operations, but there is no direct public evidence of owning FP&A, financial reporting, or IPO readiness tasks.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Promoted from VP of Operations & Excellence to interim CTO and then permanent CTO — led organizational and process transformation for product and engineering teams.
  - Limited public information on measurable outcomes tied directly to her leadership (Known Gaps).

### Team Leadership

- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence Level:** High
- **Confidence:** High
- **Reasoning:** Multiple first-party sources (Collibra press release and blog) document her promotion from VP of Operations & Excellence to interim CTO and then CTO, and describe 15+ years of engineering leadership and organizational/process transformation—strong evidence of leadership and internal promotion.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Appointed permanently as CTO in July 2021 after serving as interim CTO earlier that year.
  - Led organizational and process transformation for product and engineering teams; 15+ years of engineering leadership experience.
- **Citations:**

### GTM Partnership

- **Score:** 2
- **Evidence Level:** Low
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Reasoning:** Public materials emphasize technical, product and operational leadership but provide little evidence of cross-functional GTM partnership with sales, customer success, or marketing (e.g., driving packaging/pricing, renewals, or revenue operations).
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Public-facing thought leadership and operational excellence are documented, but no explicit public examples of GTM partnership or revenue-impact initiatives.
  - Known Gaps: Fundraising experience not documented; limited public record of measurable outcomes tied to leadership.

### Systems Modernization

- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence Level:** High
- **Confidence:** High
- **Reasoning:** First-party sources and industry pieces describe her domain expertise in enterprise data intelligence, cloud-native and distributed systems, and running engineering/process transformation—directly relevant to modernizing platforms and engineering practices.
- **Evidence Quotes:**
  - Technical domain expertise in enterprise data intelligence, cloud-native and distributed systems, and a focus on operational excellence.
  - Led organizational and process transformation for product and engineering teams.
- **Citations:**

## Must-Haves Check
| Requirement | Met | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IPO prep | No | No public documentation that Madalina has led IPO readiness or acted in an IPO-prep capacity (Known Gaps). |
| SaaS ARR >$50M | No | No verifiable public ARR figure provided in the research; Collibra is late-stage but ARR >$50M is not documented in supplied sources. |

## Signal Inventory
### Green Flags
- Internal promotion to CTO from VP Operations & Excellence indicates strong internal credibility and successful leadership at Collibra (Collibra press release).
- Documented experience leading organizational and process transformation for product and engineering — valuable for scaling engineering and delivery (Collibra blog, DevOps articles).
- Technical domain expertise in enterprise data intelligence, cloud-native and distributed systems aligns with modern SaaS platform needs (press release, blog).
- Public thought leadership (Collibra blog, podcasts, DevOps) shows visibility and capacity to represent engineering externally.

### Red Flags
- No documented fundraising or capital markets experience — risk if board needs an operator who can lead investor conversations or IPO process (supported by absence of fundraising evidence).
- Limited independent, measurable outcomes publicly attributable to her leadership (no clear product revenue/SCALING metrics cited).
- Sparse public career history prior to Collibra and no LinkedIn URL located — makes reference checks and prior-role validation harder for a board.
- No public evidence of direct GTM/Revenue operations partnership — risk for roles requiring tight engineering↔sales alignment on packaging/pricing.

## Counterfactual Evidence Requests
- If she has demonstrable, recent (last 3 years) leadership of cross-functional revenue initiatives (e.g., drove packaging/renewals/sales-engine work), GTM Partnership could move 2→4.
- If she led or materially contributed to an IPO-prep program or served as an executive sponsor for investor diligence at Collibra, Fundraising Excellence and IPO-prep must-have could move 2→4 and IPO-prep would flip to met.
- If she can provide verifiable metrics showing she owned platform or org changes that directly increased ARR or reduced churn (with figures), Strategic Finance Ops and Team Leadership scores could move 3→4 and 4→5 respectively.
- If references confirm prior senior roles with documented outcomes (pre-Collibra) currently undocumented in public sources, overall confidence would increase from Medium→High and multiple dimension scores could each move +1.
